(Intuitively yes: more positivity constraints means fewer states.) (2) If M_1 = M_2 as sets, is S_{M_1} = S_{M_2}? (Should be yes, but needs statement.) (3) Can different quadratic modules M_1 ≠ M_2 give the same state space S_{M_1} = S_{M_2}? (4) Is the map M ↦ S_M order-reversing? These properties are fundamental for understanding how changes in M affect the state space, which is likely crucial for the Archimedean closure theorem.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
