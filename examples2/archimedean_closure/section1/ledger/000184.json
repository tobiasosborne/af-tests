The parent node 1.3.1 says the condition suffices 'for the following reasons' (plural). However, node 1.3.1.1 alone does NOT constitute a complete argument. It only claims that Lemma 2.1 needs bounds on a^*a, but does NOT explain: (1) Why Lemma 2.1 is the ONLY place we need the Archimedean property, (2) Why no other downstream results need bounds on arbitrary x ∈ (A_0)_sa. This is at most a necessary condition, not a sufficient one.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
