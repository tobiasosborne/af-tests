Does this mean: (1) Free algebra in the category of algebras with the generators as basis? (2) Free *-algebra in the category of *-algebras with involution constraint g_i* = g_i? (3) Universal *-algebra with respect to some relations? The category and universal property must be explicit.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
