Since M-positive states are linear functionals phi: A_0 -\u003e C, and A_0 is infinite-dimensional, the collection of all such functionals could potentially be too large to be a set. This requires either (a) proof that S_M satisfies a set-theoretic size bound, or (b) working in a framework where this is automatically handled (e.g., stating S_M is a subset of the algebraic dual A_0^#).","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
