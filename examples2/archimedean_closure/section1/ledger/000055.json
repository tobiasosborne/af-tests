Therefore a^*a is automatically in M (take single term with i=1). So 'N·1 - a^*a in M' requires N·1 in M + a^*a. But this is NOT equivalent to 'N·1 - a^*a in M' since M is not necessarily closed under subtraction (it's a cone/module, not necessarily a subspace). The statement needs clarification: is M assumed to be closed under addition and subtraction?","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
