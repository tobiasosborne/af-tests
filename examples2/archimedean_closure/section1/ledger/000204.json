(A_0 has no specified topology or norm!) (2) Are states automatically bounded? (In C*-algebras yes; in general *-algebras NO.) (3) What is ||phi|| for phi in S_M? Is it always 1? (4) Is S_M contained in the continuous dual (A_0)* or only the algebraic dual A_0^#? For the free *-algebra A_0 = C\u003cg_1,...,g_n\u003e, there is NO canonical norm or topology. This means: (a) States could be unbounded functionals, (b) Weak-* topology is undefined without a norm, (c) Completeness properties are unknown. The lack of norm structure makes many standard operator algebra techniques INAPPLICABLE. This is a fundamental issue that must be resolved.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
