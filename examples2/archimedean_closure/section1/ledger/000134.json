The definition M := {Σ_i a_i^* a_i + Σ_{j,k} b_{jk}^* g_j b_{jk}} clearly shows closure under addition (combine finite sums), and positive scalars can factor: r·(Σ a_i^* a_i) = Σ (√r·a_i)^* (√r·a_i), BUT this requires √r to be well-defined in A_0, which may not hold for arbitrary real r ≥ 0. At minimum, need to prove: for rational r = p/q \u003e 0, r·M ⊆ M. For irrational r, need closure argument or limiting process, which may require topology not yet established.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
