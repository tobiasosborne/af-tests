But to PROVE M is generating for (A_0)_sa might REQUIRE the standard Archimedean condition, not the weaker one. This creates potential circularity: we justify the weaker condition by citing a property (M generating) that might only be provable under the stronger condition. Where is Lemma 2.3 proven, and what assumptions does IT use?","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
