Standard practice in functional analysis uses: (1) For complex numbers z, 'z \u003e= 0' means z is real and z \u003e= 0 as a real number, (2) For operators, 'A \u003e= 0' means A is positive semidefinite. The statement should either: (a) use 'phi(m) is real and \u003e= 0', or (b) define the ordering on C at the beginning of section 1, or (c) use notation like 'phi(m) in R_+' or 'Re(phi(m)) \u003e= 0'.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
