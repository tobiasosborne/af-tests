According to the prover context, 'Definitions in scope: (none found)'. A generating cone K for a vector space V means V = K - K (every element can be written as a difference of two cone elements). This is proved in Lemma 2.3 for M ∩ (A₀)ₛₐ, but the general definition must be in scope before this claim can be understood. Either add the definition as a dependency or state it explicitly.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
