Otherwise phi(m) need not be real. But node 1.2 defines M = { sum_i a_i^* a_i + sum_{j,k} b_{jk}^* g_j b_{jk} }, and it is NOT obvious that every element of this form is self-adjoint. This needs: (1) explicit statement that m in M implies m = m^*, or (2) proof that the generating set for M consists of self-adjoint elements.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
