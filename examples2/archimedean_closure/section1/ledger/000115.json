The claim omits hypothesis (1)-(3) and only mentions the generating cone. This is insufficient - the theorem requires MORE than just a generating cone. It requires the specific extension setup (subspace, functional positive on cone intersection). The claim is therefore INCOMPLETE and potentially misleading.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
