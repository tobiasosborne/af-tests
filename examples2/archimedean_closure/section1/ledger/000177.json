Does N include 0 or start at 1? Is this the standard natural numbers? Also, the notation 'N·1' suggests scalar multiplication - is this defined for natural numbers, or does it mean repeated addition 1+1+...+1 (N times)? These are different operations and need clarification.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
