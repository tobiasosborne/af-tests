However, combined with phi(m) \u003e= 0 for m in M, this should imply that phi is bounded. Specifically, if 1 is in M (which should be verified), then for any a in A_0, the Archimedean condition (node 1.3) states N·1 - a^*a is in M for large N, hence phi(N·1 - a^*a) \u003e= 0, giving N - phi(a^*a) \u003e= 0, so phi(a^*a) \u003c= N. This boundedness property should be proven explicitly.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
