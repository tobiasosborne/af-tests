This is critical for the entire theory. Can you exhibit even ONE M-positive state? For example, does the evaluation at a *-representation give an M-positive state? Without proving S_M non-empty, the subsequent theory may be vacuous. This should be established as a separate lemma, possibly using the GNS construction or the Hahn-Banach theorem.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
