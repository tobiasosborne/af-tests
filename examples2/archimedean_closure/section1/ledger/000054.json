The definition of M in node 1.2 shows M consists of sums of squares and conjugations by generators. This SHOULD imply M consists of self-adjoint elements, but this fact must be proven as a lemma, not assumed. Proof: (a^*a)^* = a^*a and (b^*g_j b)^* = b^*g_j^* b = b^*g_j b since g_j is self-adjoint. Therefore every element of M is self-adjoint. This must be established explicitly.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
