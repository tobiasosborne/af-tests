In ordered vector spaces, an order unit is an element u such that for every x in the space, there exists n in N with -nu ≤ x ≤ nu. The standard Archimedean condition mentioned in parent node 1.3.1 (∀x ∈ (A₀)ₛₐ, ∃N: N·1 - x ∈ M) DOES provide an order unit, namely 1. The claim should explicitly define 'order unit' and explain why the Riesz-Kantorovich theorem doesn't require one.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
