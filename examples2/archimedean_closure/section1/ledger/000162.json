Does it mean: (1) 'The fact that M is a cone and is generating for (A_0)_sa is proved in Lemma 2.3', or (2) 'M is a cone (proved elsewhere), and M is generating for (A_0)_sa (proved in Lemma 2.3)', or (3) 'M is called a cone, and Lemma 2.3 proves the generating property'? The parenthetical remark's scope is unclear. Suggest rephrasing to: 'The quadratic module M (defined in 1.2) is a generating cone for (A_0)_sa. This is proved in Section 2, Lemma 2.3.'","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
