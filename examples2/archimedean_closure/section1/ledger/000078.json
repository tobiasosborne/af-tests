Then phi(1) = 0, which violates this condition. However, the zero functional IS positive (satisfies phi(m) \u003e= 0 for all m in M trivially). The definition should either: (a) explicitly exclude the zero functional, or (b) explain why requiring phi(1) = 1 automatically excludes it. This is a gap in the definition.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
