An assumption is something we take as given without proof, but the statement explicitly references a proof. This is contradictory. If Lemma 2.3 proves this, then this should be a 'by_theorem' or 'by_lemma' inference with dependency on 2.3. If this is truly an assumption, remove the reference to Lemma 2.3 and admit we're assuming this without proof (which taints the entire argument).","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
