This definition uses 'M-positive state' which only requires phi(m) \u003e= 0 for m in M. These are NOT the same concept. An M-positive state may not be positive in the standard sense (unless M contains all elements of the form a^*a). The relationship between M-positive states and standard states must be clarified to avoid confusion.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
