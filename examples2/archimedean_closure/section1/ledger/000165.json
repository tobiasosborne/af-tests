Convexity of S_M is crucial for: (1) Krein-Milman theorem applications (expressing states as convex combinations/integrals over extreme points), (2) Choquet theory, (3) Optimization arguments (finding states that maximize/minimize certain functionals), (4) Separation theorems. We need explicit verification: If phi, psi in S_M and t in [0,1], is t*phi + (1-t)*psi in S_M? This requires checking: (a) Linearity is preserved (automatic), (b) Normalization: (t*phi + (1-t)*psi)(1) = t*1 + (1-t)*1 = 1 ✓, (c) M-positivity: (t*phi + (1-t)*psi)(m) = t*phi(m) + (1-t)*psi(m) \u003e= 0 for m in M (TRUE since phi(m), psi(m) \u003e= 0). While convexity likely holds, it must be STATED.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
