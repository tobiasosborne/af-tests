This suggests that some version of Riesz extension DOES require an order unit. Which version? Without specifying what alternative formulation requires an order unit, the claim lacks context. Is this referring to: (1) Hahn-Banach extension in ordered normed spaces with order units? (2) Some other extension theorem? The contrast is meaningless without identifying what's being compared against.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
