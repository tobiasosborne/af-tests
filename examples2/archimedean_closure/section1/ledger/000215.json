The proof of the second inequality (2.2.2) uses: 'By 1.3, N_a·1 - a^*a ∈ M. Hence φ(N_a·1 - a^*a) ≥ 0, yielding φ(a^*a) ≤ N_a.' This confirms the claim is technically correct: the proof only uses 1.3's bound on a^*a, not bounds on arbitrary self-adjoint elements. However, this verification should be part of the formal proof, not left implicit.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
