What is the multiplication operation on A_0? Is it associative? Distributive? Is there a unit for multiplication (beyond just 'unital' claiming one exists)? How does multiplication interact with the involution? The notation suggests A_0 is an algebra over C, but this needs explicit axioms.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
