But (A_0)_sa contains BOTH positive and negative self-adjoint elements. The standard condition must handle ARBITRARY self-adjoint x, including potentially unbounded-below elements. The weaker condition only handles a^*a which are bounded below by 0. This is NOT a simple weakening - it's a different type of condition entirely.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
