For a linear functional on a *-algebra to preserve the interaction between positivity and the *-structure, this property is typically required. Without it, even if phi(m) is real for m in M, we cannot guarantee that phi respects the algebraic structure properly. Either add phi(a^*) = overline{phi(a)} as a requirement, or prove it follows from the other conditions.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
