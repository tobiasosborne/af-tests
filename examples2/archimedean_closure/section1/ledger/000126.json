This creates a potential circular dependency: Section 1's Archimedean assumption justification depends on properties claimed about Section 2, but Section 2's Lemma 2.1 proof (step 2.2.2) explicitly uses Section 1's assumption 1.3. The claim must establish why this forward reference is not circular.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
