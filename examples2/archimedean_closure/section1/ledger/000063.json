What does it mean precisely for a cone M to be 'generating for (A_0)_sa'? Is this: (1) every element of (A_0)_sa can be written as a difference of elements in M, or (2) the cone M spans (A_0)_sa as a real vector space, or (3) some other definition? The statement must define this term explicitly or reference a prior definition.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
