Does it mean: (a) M is the MINIMAL set where phi must be positive (i.e., phi(m) \u003e= 0 for m in M, but phi could be negative elsewhere), (b) M is the MAXIMAL set where phi is positive (i.e., phi is positive on M and possibly on a larger set), or (c) M determines phi uniquely via positivity? In standard operator theory, a positive functional satisfies phi(a^* a) \u003e= 0 for ALL a, not just on a subset. Clarify the relationship between positivity on M and standard positivity.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
