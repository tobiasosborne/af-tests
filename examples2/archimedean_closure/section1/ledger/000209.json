Does it mean: (a) The theorem hypothesis includes X but does not include Y? (b) The theorem can be proved using only X without assuming Y? (c) In this specific application, we have X but not Y, and X suffices? Mathematically rigorous statements should say 'The hypotheses of Riesz-Kantorovich include a generating cone but do not require an order unit' rather than the informal 'requires only'.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
