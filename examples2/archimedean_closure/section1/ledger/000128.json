It should depend on: (1) The statement of the Riesz-Kantorovich theorem (Section 5.3.4.3), (2) Lemma 2.3 which proves M ∩ (A₀)ₛₐ is a generating cone, (3) The definition of 'generating cone' which is used but not defined in scope. Without these dependencies, the claim is ungrounded.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
