The indices i, j, k are not defined. What sets do they range over? Is i arbitrary? Does j range from 1 to n? What about k? The phrase 'finite sums' suggests these are finite index sets, but this needs to be explicit. Without defining the index sets, the formula is ambiguous.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
