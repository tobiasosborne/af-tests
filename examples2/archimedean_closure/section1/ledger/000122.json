In functional analysis, the existence of states is highly non-trivial. For S_M to be non-empty, we need: (1) At least one linear functional phi: A_0 -\u003e C exists with phi(1)=1, and (2) Such a phi satisfies phi(m)\u003e=0 for all m in M. Without the Archimedean assumption or additional structure, this is not automatic. A quadratic module M could be so large that no positive linear functional extends to A_0, or the normalization condition phi(1)=1 might be incompatible with positivity on M. This is a CRITICAL gap that must be addressed before using S_M in subsequent arguments.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
