These are different mathematical concepts. A quadratic module has specific algebraic structure (closed under sums and multiplication by squares), while a cone is a different structure (closed under positive scalar multiplication and addition). Is M actually a cone in the technical sense? This needs rigorous proof: (a) show 0 ∈ M, (b) show m1, m2 ∈ M implies m1 + m2 ∈ M, (c) show m ∈ M and r ≥ 0 implies r·m ∈ M.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
