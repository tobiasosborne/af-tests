This notation is ambiguous: does it mean the free algebra over C generated by g_1,...,g_n? The free unital algebra? The free *-algebra? The universal enveloping algebra of some structure? Angle brackets are used in many different contexts in mathematics, so this needs clarification.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
