But HOW does the fact that Riesz extension only needs a generating cone (not an order unit) relate to the weaker Archimedean condition? The logical connection is missing. The weaker condition (∃N: N·1 - a*a ∈ M for all a) doesn't give us bounds on all self-adjoint elements. The generating cone property (Lemma 2.3) bridges this gap. But this claim doesn't EXPLAIN the connection - it just states a fact about Riesz extension in isolation.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
