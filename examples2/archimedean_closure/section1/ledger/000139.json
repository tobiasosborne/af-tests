While Section 2 exists in the broader document, there is no formal external reference, definition, or dependency declared for this lemma in the AF proof tree. The statement must either: (1) add an external reference to Lemma 2.1, (2) add a dependency on node 2.1 (if it exists), or (3) inline the actual requirements rather than referencing an out-of-scope lemma.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
