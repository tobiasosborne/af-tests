For a *-algebra over C, this distinction is crucial. Standard states on C*-algebras are C-linear and satisfy phi(a^*a) \u003e= 0. However, the definition here requires phi(m) \u003e= 0 for m in M. For this to be consistent with complex linearity, we need m self-adjoint implies phi(m) is real. This property must be proven or stated as a requirement.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
