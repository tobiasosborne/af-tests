This creates a circular dependency problem: we cannot use Lemma 2.3 to justify the Archimedean condition being weaker if Lemma 2.3 itself might depend on the Archimedean condition. Either (a) Lemma 2.3 must be proven BEFORE this node, or (b) this node must be moved to AFTER Section 2, or (c) a self-contained argument must be given here without forward reference.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
