For a_i^* a_i: (a_i^* a_i)^* = a_i^* a_i (OK). For b_{jk}^* g_j b_{jk}: since g_j is self-adjoint, (b_{jk}^* g_j b_{jk})^* = b_{jk}^* g_j^* b_{jk} = b_{jk}^* g_j b_{jk} (OK). BUT: M is closed under SUMS, and sum of self-adjoint elements is self-adjoint, so M consists of self-adjoint elements. However, this reasoning is NOWHERE in the proof tree. It should be a separate lemma with dependencies on 1.2.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
