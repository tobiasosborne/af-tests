Is the unit element 1 in M? This is crucial because: (1) If 1 in M, then phi(1) \u003e= 0 is automatic from condition 2, making this condition partially redundant. (2) If 1 not in M, this should be stated. (3) In standard quadratic module theory, 1 = 1^* · 1 should be in M, but this needs verification given the specific definition in 1.2.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
