Is this: (1) merely a comment/observation that doesn't need verification, (2) a claim that must be proven, or (3) part of the formal proof structure? If it's just a remark for intuition, it should be marked as such and not block the proof. If it's a formal claim, remove the word 'Remark:' and prove it.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
