In the first case, \u003e= is standard ordering on R (assuming phi(m) is real). But in the second case, what does pi(g_j) \u003e= 0 mean for an operator? Is this the positive operator ordering? This requires pi(g_j) to be self-adjoint first. None of this is defined.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
