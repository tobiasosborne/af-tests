But reason (b) - that M is generating - is claimed to be proved in Section 2, not derived from the weaker condition. This creates a logical structure error: we need to show the weaker condition IMPLIES these properties, not reference independent proofs. The correct structure should be: (1) assume weaker condition, (2) derive that M is generating FROM the weaker condition, (3) conclude sufficiency. Simply citing Lemma 2.3 doesn't show the weaker condition is sufficient unless Lemma 2.3 explicitly uses only the weaker condition.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
