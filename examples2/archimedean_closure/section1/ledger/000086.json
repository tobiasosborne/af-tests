Is this: (a) A global assumption for the entire proof? (b) A local assumption for section 1 only? (c) A hypothesis that will be discharged later? The inference type 'assumption' suggests it's maintained throughout, but 'local_assume' suggests limited scope. This is contradictory.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
