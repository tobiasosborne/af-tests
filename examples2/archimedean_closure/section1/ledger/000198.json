The statement provides NO information about: (1) What are the pure (extremal) states in S_M? (2) Does S_M have any pure states? (For infinite-dimensional algebras, this is non-trivial.) (3) Is every state in S_M a convex combination/integral over pure states? (Krein-Milman-type theorem) (4) Are pure M-positive states characterized by some additional property (e.g., being multiplicative, irreducible representations, etc.)? (5) Is the set of pure states dense in S_M in any topology? Understanding the pure state structure is ESSENTIAL for: (a) GNS construction and irreducible representations, (b) Decomposition theory, (c) Approximation arguments. This gap must be addressed in the formalization.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
