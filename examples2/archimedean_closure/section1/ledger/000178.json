This is not an assumption - it's either: (a) a THEOREM (if proved), (b) an EXTERNAL (if citing a reference), or (c) a LEMMA (if it's a consequence of the cited theorem). The inference type 'assumption' is incorrect for a verifiable mathematical fact about a known theorem. It should be reclassified.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
