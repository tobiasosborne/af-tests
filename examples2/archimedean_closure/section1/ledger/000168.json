This is a non-trivial foundational dependency. The claim should acknowledge: (1) The theorem requires the Axiom of Choice (via Zorn's lemma), (2) The extension is not constructive, (3) There may be multiple possible extensions. These caveats are mathematically significant and their omission makes the claim incomplete.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
