But if Lemma 2.3 (which supposedly proves M is generating) ITSELF uses the Archimedean assumption from node 1.3, then we have circular reasoning: we're using the Archimedean assumption to prove M is generating, then using M being generating to justify the Archimedean assumption being sufficient. The proof of Lemma 2.3 must be inspected to verify it does NOT depend on any form of the Archimedean condition.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
