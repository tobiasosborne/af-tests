For example, in many moment problem theorems, one needs to integrate functions a ↦ phi(a) over the state space S_M with respect to some measure. Without specifying: (a) What σ-algebra on S_M? (Borel with respect to what topology?) (b) What measures are relevant? (c) Are evaluation maps phi ↦ phi(a) measurable? The proof may be incomplete. This is flagged as a NOTE since it may not be needed, but if integration over S_M appears later, this becomes CRITICAL.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
