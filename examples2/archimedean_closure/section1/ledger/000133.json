In operator algebra and functional analysis, state spaces are typically equipped with one of several natural topologies: (a) weak-* topology (as S_M ⊆ A_0^* ⊆ A_0^#), (b) norm topology, (c) pointwise convergence topology, or (d) no topology at all. The choice of topology is CRITICAL for: (1) Defining convergence of sequences/nets of states, (2) Compactness properties (needed for existence arguments), (3) Continuity of maps involving S_M, (4) Integration theory and GNS construction variants. Without specifying the topology, subsequent uses of S_M will be ambiguous or ill-defined.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
