In general measure theory and functional analysis, positive functionals can be scaled by any positive constant. We could define phi(1) = c for any c \u003e 0 and all results would remain valid after rescaling. The choice of '1' is conventional but not mathematically necessary. This needs justification or acknowledgment that it's a normalization choice.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
