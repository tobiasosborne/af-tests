But the Archimedean property references 'all a in A_0'. Since A_0 is the free *-algebra on n generators, elements are non-commutative polynomials. For such a, what is the norm/size of a^*a? Without a norm or ordering, how do we interpret 'N·1 dominates a^*a' (which is the intuitive content of N·1 - a^*a being positive)?","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
