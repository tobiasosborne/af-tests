A set M with a specific formula is given, but what are the axioms that make M a 'quadratic module'? Is this a standard mathematical structure? What properties must it satisfy? The definition appears circular: M is defined by a formula, but 'quadratic module' suggests a categorical/axiomatic definition.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
