(Answer: Yes, straightforward.) (2) Is S_M weak-* compact? (This requires functional analysis, specifically Banach-Alaoglu or similar arguments.) (3) What is the natural topology on S_M? These properties are standard prerequisites for moment problems and representation theorems. They should be stated and proven as separate lemmas.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
