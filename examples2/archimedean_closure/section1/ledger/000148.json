Or can there be many different linear functionals phi satisfying both phi(1) = 1 and phi(m) \u003e= 0 for all m in M? The statement suggests this is just ONE condition among two, implying non-uniqueness, but this should be explicit. The set S_M (introduced in 1.4.3) could be empty, a singleton, or infinite.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
