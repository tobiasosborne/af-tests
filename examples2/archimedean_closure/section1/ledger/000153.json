This is a strong uniqueness claim. To verify this, we need: (1) What EXACTLY does Lemma 2.1 require as inputs? (2) Proof that it does NOT require bounds on arbitrary self-adjoint x. (3) Proof that the weaker bound (on a^*a only) is SUFFICIENT for Lemma 2.1's proof. The word 'only' makes a completeness claim that must be rigorously justified.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
