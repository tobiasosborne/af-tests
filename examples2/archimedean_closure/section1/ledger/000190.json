But why not allow phi(1) = -1 or other negative values? If we only care about 'M-positive' behavior (phi(m) \u003e= 0 for m in M), why does the global normalization need to be positive? Could there be interesting 'signed states' with phi(1) ≠ 1? The restriction to phi(1) = 1 \u003e 0 seems arbitrary without explanation.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
