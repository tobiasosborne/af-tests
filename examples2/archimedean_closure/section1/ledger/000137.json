But how is phi evaluated? Is it applied to 1 as an abstract element of A_0, or as a polynomial/expression? Since A_0 is freely generated, elements have multiple representations. Does phi(1) mean 'phi applied to the empty word' or 'phi applied to the unit element'? This ambiguity must be resolved.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
