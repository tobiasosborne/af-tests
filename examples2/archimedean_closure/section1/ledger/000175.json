Does it mean: (1) For each fixed a ∈ A_0, there exists a bound N_a such that N_a·1 - a^*a ∈ M (which IS the stated assumption 1.3)? (2) Uniform bounds over all a? (3) Bounds on the operator norm of a^*a in some representation? The phrase must be made mathematically precise to be verifiable.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
