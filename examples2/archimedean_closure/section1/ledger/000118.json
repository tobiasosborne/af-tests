The classical Archimedean property states: for positive reals x,y there exists n with nx \u003e y. How does 'N·1 - a^*a in M' connect to this intuition? Without explaining the analogy (e.g., M is a 'positive cone' and this prevents 'infinitesimals'), the name is unmotivated and potentially misleading.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
