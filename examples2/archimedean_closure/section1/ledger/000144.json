If every x in (A_0)_sa can be written as x = m1 - m2 with m1, m2 in M, and we have N·1 - a^*a in M for all a, this does NOT immediately imply N·1 - x in M for all x. The proof requires: (1) showing how to bound arbitrary x using bounds on a^*a, (2) proving that the same N works, and (3) handling the case where x might not be of the form a^*a. These steps are missing.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
