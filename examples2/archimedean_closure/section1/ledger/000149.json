The statement provides no information about whether S_M is: (a) Compact in the weak-* topology (standard for norm-bounded states on C*-algebras), (b) Locally compact, (c) σ-compact, or (d) Not compact at all. For an infinite-dimensional free *-algebra A_0 = C\u003cg_1,...,g_n\u003e, the state space structure is highly non-trivial. Without addressing compactness, key existence and approximation arguments in the proof may fail or require additional hypotheses.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
