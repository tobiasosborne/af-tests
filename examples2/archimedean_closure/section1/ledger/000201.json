It is making a CLAIM about what another lemma requires. The inference type should be one of: (1) 'claim' that needs to be proven by analyzing Lemma 2.1's proof, (2) 'observation' if it's meant to be obvious from inspection, (3) 'reference' if citing an external fact. Using 'assumption' here is misleading - we are not assuming Lemma 2.1 has certain requirements; we must VERIFY this claim by examining the lemma.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
