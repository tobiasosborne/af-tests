Where is the theorem statement that shows this? The cited Riesz-Kantorovich theorem (Section 5.3.4.3, Aliprantis-Tourky Theorem 1.26) does indeed only require a generating cone K, but this needs to be EXPLICITLY CITED. The claim reads as an unsubstantiated assertion. Either provide: (a) a reference to the exact theorem statement showing no order unit is needed, or (b) a proof that the generating cone hypothesis is sufficient.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
