Then 'positivity on M' means phi is positive on ALL of A_0, which seems overly restrictive. What if M = {0}? Then positivity is vacuous. The definition should clarify: (1) Is M assumed to be a PROPER subset of A_0? (2) Is M assumed to be non-empty? (3) Are there structural requirements on M beyond the quadratic module definition? The interplay between the size of M and the set of M-positive states S_M needs clarification.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
