While S_M for 'state space associated with quadratic module M' is reasonable, there is potential for confusion. Consider: (1) Is this notation standard in the literature on quadratic modules and moments problems? (2) Could it conflict with other uses of S in this proof? (3) Would a more explicit notation like States_M or Σ_M be clearer? This is a minor issue but notation conflicts can cause serious confusion in complex proofs.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
