Complex numbers are not ordered - there is no natural ordering on C that makes \u003e= well-defined. This is a fundamental type error. Either: (1) phi should map to R, or (2) the statement should require phi(m) to be real for all m in M, then phi(m) \u003e= 0 makes sense.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
