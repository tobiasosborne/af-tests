But in a *-algebra without order, what does it mean for N·1 - x to be 'in M'? Since M is defined as a quadratic module (sums of a^*a and b^* g_j b terms), membership in M is well-defined. But the ordering relationship needs clarification: does 'x in M' mean x ≥ 0 in some order, or literally that x can be written in the quadratic form? Please clarify the interpretation.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
