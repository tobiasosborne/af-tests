'Riesz extension' could refer to multiple theorems: (1) Riesz-Kantorovich extension theorem for positive linear functionals, (2) Riesz representation theorem, (3) Riesz extension property for Banach lattices. Which specific theorem is being referenced? The proof uses Riesz-Kantorovich (see Section 5.3.4.3), but this should be explicitly stated in the claim.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
