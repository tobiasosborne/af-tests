It says 'Lemma 2.1 only requires...' which is a statement ABOUT the proof, not a mathematical theorem or definition. Should this be: (1) A comment/annotation rather than a formal proof node? (2) Reformulated as a mathematical claim (e.g., 'The Archimedean bound N_a on a^*a is sufficient input for the inequality φ(a^*a) ≤ N_a')? (3) Part of a proof strategy document rather than the formal proof tree? The mixing of meta-level and object-level claims undermines rigor.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
