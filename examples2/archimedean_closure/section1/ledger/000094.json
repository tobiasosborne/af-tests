A standard positive functional satisfies phi(a^* a) \u003e= 0 for ALL a. Since M contains all such elements, does 'positivity on M' actually imply STANDARD positivity? If YES, then why not just define M-positive states as standard positive states + normalization? If NO, then M-positivity is strictly weaker than standard positivity, and we need to understand what M captures that standard positivity doesn't.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
