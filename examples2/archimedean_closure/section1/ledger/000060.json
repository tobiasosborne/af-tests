Node 1.1 defines A_0 as a 'unital' algebra, which typically means it contains a multiplicative identity, but this identity element is never formally introduced or defined. What is '1'? Is it the unit of A_0? If so, this should be stated explicitly: 'phi(1_{A_0}) = 1'.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
