What IS the Archimedean closure theorem? What is being closed? Under what operation? This creates a circular reference: we're defining foundations for a theorem that isn't defined yet. How can we verify these are the RIGHT foundations if we don't know what theorem they support?","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
