This node should depend on: (1) The statement of Lemma 2.1 (to know what it claims), (2) The proof of Lemma 2.1 (to analyze what it actually uses), (3) Possibly the definition of 'bounds on a^*a' to make the claim precise. Without these dependencies, the claim cannot be verified within the proof tree.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
