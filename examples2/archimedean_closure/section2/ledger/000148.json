A 'sum of a single term' is not a sum at all - it is just that single term. The claim seems to be that (1+x)*(1+x) IS of the form a*a for some element a. If so, what is a? Presumably a = 1+x. But then the statement should simply say '(1+x)*(1+x) is of the form a*a where a = 1+x'. The word 'sums' is confusing and suggests a finite sum of such terms, but then 'single' contradicts this.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
