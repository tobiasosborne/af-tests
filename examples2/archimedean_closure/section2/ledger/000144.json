However, M itself is not defined in this proof tree. Looking at node 1.1.2, it mentions 'definition 1.2' and 'definition 1.3' for Archimedean property, but neither M nor its Archimedean closure are formally defined here. The dependency on the definition of M must be explicit.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
