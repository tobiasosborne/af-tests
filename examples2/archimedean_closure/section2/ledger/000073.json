However, Definition 4.1 is NOT formally registered in this proof (the definitions list is empty). Without an explicit, verified definition of ||·||_M as this supremum, the equality ||a||_M = sup_{ψ ∈ S_M} |ψ(a)| is unjustified. The node should declare an explicit dependency on a node establishing this definition.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
