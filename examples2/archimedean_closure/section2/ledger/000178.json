In the context of *-algebras, a*a typically means 'a adjoint times a', i.e., (a*)(a) where a* is the involution of a. But (1+x)* could also be parsed as multiplication followed by involution. The standard reading should be ((1+x)*)(1+x) = (1+x*)(1+x) = (1+x)(1+x) when x = x*. The statement should use parentheses to disambiguate: ((1+x)*)·(1+x) or adopt cleaner notation like |1+x|² := (1+x)*(1+x).","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
