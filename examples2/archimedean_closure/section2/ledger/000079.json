The form being sesquilinear requires: (1) linearity in the second argument: ⟨x, αy+βz⟩ = α⟨x,y⟩ + β⟨x,z⟩, and (2) conjugate-linearity in the first argument: ⟨αx+βy, z⟩ = α*⟨x,z⟩ + β*⟨y,z⟩. Neither property has been established for ⟨·,·⟩_φ. Property (1) follows from linearity of φ if φ is linear. Property (2) requires φ to preserve the *-operation in a specific way. These must be verified before claiming the form is 'positive semidefinite' (which only applies to sesquilinear forms).","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
