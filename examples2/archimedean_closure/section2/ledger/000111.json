However, ||·||_M = sup_{ψ ∈ S_M}|ψ(a)| is only a SEMINORM (it may not separate points - we could have ||a||_M = 0 for nonzero a). The statement should clarify whether ||·||_M is a norm or seminorm, and if seminorm, whether continuity is with respect to the seminorm topology or the quotient norm topology.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
