This implies that the purpose of node 1.2.1.1 is to establish that (1+x)*(1+x) and (1-x)*(1-x) have the form required by 'definition 1.2' to be in M. However, definition 1.2 is not in scope and M is never defined. Without knowing what M is and what definition 1.2 says, the statement 'sums of a single a*a term' cannot be verified to be the correct characterization of membership in M.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
