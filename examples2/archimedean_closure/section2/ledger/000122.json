The inequality chain |phi(a)|^2 \u003c= phi(a*a) \u003c= N_a implicitly assumes phi(a*a) is a real number (not complex) and non-negative. For general functionals phi, phi(a*a) could be complex. This requires: (1) phi is a *-homomorphism or at least preserves self-adjointness, and (2) phi(positive elements) \u003e= 0. Neither is stated. If phi is merely linear, phi(a*a) could be any complex number.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
