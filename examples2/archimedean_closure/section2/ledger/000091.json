This is only valid if the supremum is taken over a set that INCLUDES φ. The step assumes 'φ ∈ S_M implies φ is among the ψ's in the sup'. But this requires: (1) S_M is nonempty (otherwise the sup is undefined or -∞), (2) The value |φ(a)| is indeed one of the values in the family {|ψ(a)| : ψ ∈ S_M}. The step is essentially tautological IF S_M is defined correctly, but this proof has not established that S_M even has any elements.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
