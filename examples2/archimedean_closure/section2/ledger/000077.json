Expanding: (a*a)* = a*(a*)* (by anti-homomorphism). For this to equal a*a, we need (a*)* = a (the involution is an involution). This is an axiom of *-algebras that must be declared as an external reference. Currently no such external reference exists in scope.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
