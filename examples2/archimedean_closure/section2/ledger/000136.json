To establish Lipschitz continuity |φ(a) - φ(b)| ≤ ||a - b||_M, we need both a, b ∈ A_0 and must verify that a - b ∈ A_0 (i.e., A_0 is closed under subtraction). While this is likely true if A_0 is a vector space or algebra, this closure property was never explicitly stated or invoked.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
