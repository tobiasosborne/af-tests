This property comes from φ being an 'M-positive state' (see node 1.3). However, node 1.3.1.3 has NO dependencies declared. It should explicitly depend on a node establishing that φ is linear (or at minimum, that states are linear functionals). Without this dependency, the logical chain is incomplete.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
