This uses scalar 1/4, but for M ∩ (A_0)_sa to be a generating cone, we need elements of M (not scalar multiples). The proof implicitly assumes (1/4)*m in M when m in M, which requires M to be closed under positive scalar multiplication. This is true for M (from definition 1.2: sums of a*a are closed under scaling by positive reals), but this closure property is never explicitly established.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
