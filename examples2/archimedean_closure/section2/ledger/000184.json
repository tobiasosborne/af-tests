Then a*a = 0, and phi(a*a) = 0, so the inequality becomes |phi(0)|^2 \u003c= 0 \u003c= N_0. This requires phi(0) = 0 (linearity) and N_0 \u003e= 0. The first follows if phi is linear; the second depends on how N_a is defined. For completeness, this trivial case should be addressed to confirm definitions are consistent.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
