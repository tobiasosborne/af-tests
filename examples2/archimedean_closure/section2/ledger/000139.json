It should explicitly state: 'For all x ∈ (A_0)_sa, there exist p, q ∈ M ∩ (A_0)_sa such that x = p - q.' The current informal phrasing obscures whether p and q depend on x (they do - specifically p = (1/4)(1+x)*(1+x) and q = (1/4)(1-x)*(1-x)), and whether this decomposition is unique (it is not).","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
