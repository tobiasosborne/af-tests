A cone C must satisfy: (i) 0 in C, (ii) if m in C and lambda \u003e= 0 then lambda*m in C, (iii) if m,n in C then m+n in C. The proof sketch (node 1.2.1) only shows the 'generating' property (every x is a difference). Where is the verification that M ∩ (A_0)_sa is actually a cone?","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
