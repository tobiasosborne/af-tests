What is S_M? The parent node 1.3.1 says 'Let φ ∈ S_M' but this only introduces φ as an element, not the definition of S_M itself. The term 'M-positive state' appears in node 1.3 but no formal definition connects S_M to M-positive states. Is S_M = {φ : A → ℂ | φ is a state and φ(m) ≥ 0 for all m ∈ M}? This needs to be explicitly stated.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
