While Lipschitz implies both (1) and (3), the exact meaning should be clarified. Furthermore, continuity itself is a weaker statement than Lipschitz - the proof establishes Lipschitz continuity but the statement conflates 'continuous' with 'Lipschitz continuous'.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
