However, the existence of this supremum as a finite real number is not established. If S_M is infinite and unbounded, the sup could be +∞. The Boundedness Lemma (1.1) gives |φ(a)|² ≤ N_a for each φ, which implies |φ(a)| ≤ √N_a, so the sup exists and is finite. But this node does not cite that result. The step should reference Lemma 1.1 to justify that ||a||_M is well-defined (finite).","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
