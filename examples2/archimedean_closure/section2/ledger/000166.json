However, node 1.2.1.4 only establishes that (A_0)_sa ⊆ (M ∩ (A_0)_sa) - (M ∩ (A_0)_sa). For the reverse inclusion (M ∩ (A_0)_sa) - (M ∩ (A_0)_sa) ⊆ (A_0)_sa, we need that M ∩ (A_0)_sa is contained in (A_0)_sa (trivially true by definition) and that (A_0)_sa is closed under subtraction (requires (A_0)_sa to be a real vector subspace). Neither is explicitly stated.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
