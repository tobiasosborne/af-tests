For a = 1+x where x is self-adjoint: a* = (1+x)* = 1+x = a. So a*a = aa = (1+x)^2. But this ONLY works because x is self-adjoint. The claim silently relies on x being self-adjoint (which is given in the parent node 1.2.1) but does not explicitly invoke this. The statement should make clear it depends on x = x*.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
