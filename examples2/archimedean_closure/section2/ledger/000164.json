Does A_0 have a multiplicative identity? Is this identity the same '1' appearing in the scalar 1/4? The notation (A_0)_sa is also undefined - presumably this denotes the self-adjoint elements of A_0, but this requires that A_0 has an involution operation. None of these are defined in the current scope (af defs returns 'No definitions found').","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
