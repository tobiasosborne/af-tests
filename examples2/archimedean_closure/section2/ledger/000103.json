For mathematical precision, this should clarify: (1) What is ||·||_M-continuous? Continuity w.r.t. the seminorm topology induced by ||·||_M? (2) Does 'continuous' here mean Lipschitz continuous (as child node 1.3.1.3 suggests with 'Lipschitz constant 1')? The statement should be precise.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
