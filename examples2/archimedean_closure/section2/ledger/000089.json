Is it unique? How is it constructed? The claim says 'the Archimedean bound' suggesting uniqueness, but Archimedean properties typically state existence of SOME bound. Is N_a = inf{N : N*1 - a*a \u003e= 0}? Or sup? Or something else? The claim is vacuously true if N_a can be arbitrarily large. The definition must be pinned down.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
