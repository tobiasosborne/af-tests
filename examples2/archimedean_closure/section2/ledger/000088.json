Definition 4.1 appears in Section 4 (section4_seminorm_closure.md), which comes AFTER Section 2. This is a circular dependency: Section 2 Corollary 2.4 claims to follow from Section 2, but it actually depends on Definition 4.1 from Section 4. The proof structure is logically unsound - you cannot use a definition that hasn't been introduced yet.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
