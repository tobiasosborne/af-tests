Expanding the RHS: (1+x)*(1+x) = (1+x*)·(1+x). For self-adjoint x (where x* = x), this gives (1+x)(1+x) = 1 + 2x + x². Similarly (1-x)*(1-x) = (1-x)(1-x) = 1 - 2x + x². Therefore RHS = (1/4)(1 + 2x + x²) - (1/4)(1 - 2x + x²) = (1/4)(4x) = x. This calculation MUST be shown explicitly - it is not self-evident and constitutes the core mathematical content of the claim.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
