The expression a*a assumes A_0 has an involution operation. Is A_0 a *-algebra? Is the involution conjugate-linear? Is it an anti-homomorphism (i.e., (ab)* = b*a*)? These properties are essential for the proof structure (especially the Cauchy-Schwarz argument in child nodes) but are nowhere stated.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
