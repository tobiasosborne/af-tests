Are these: (a) (1+x)*(1+x) and (1-x)*(1-x), or (b) (1/4)(1+x)*(1+x) and (1/4)(1-x)*(1-x)? The parent node 1.2.1 shows the decomposition with the 1/4 factors, so presumably (b), but this should be explicit. Self-adjointness of (1/4)·m requires showing that scalar multiplication by a real number preserves self-adjointness, which needs (λa)* = λ̄a* and λ = λ̄ for real λ.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
