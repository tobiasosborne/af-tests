Is N_a: (1) the SPECIFIC infimum of all N satisfying the Archimedean condition? (2) some arbitrary N that exists by 1.3? (3) a canonical choice? The parent node says 'N_a is the Archimedean bound' but the Archimedean assumption only guarantees EXISTENCE, not uniqueness. For the inequality phi(a*a) \u003c= N_a to be meaningful, N_a must be precisely defined.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
