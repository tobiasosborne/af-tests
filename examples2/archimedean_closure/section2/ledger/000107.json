The proof refers to 'M-positive states' and 'S_M'. Is M a cone in A_0? Is M = {sum of a_i*a_i : a_i in A_0}? Is M defined by a positivity condition? The claim phi(a*a) \u003c= N_a uses M implicitly (via S_M) but M itself is never specified. This is foundational and must be defined before any claim involving M can be evaluated.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
