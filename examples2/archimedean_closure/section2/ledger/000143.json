While mathematically equivalent, this creates potential confusion. The parent context says 'Let φ ∈ S_M and a ∈ A_0' but then the definition switches to ψ for the bound variable. A clearer statement would distinguish between the fixed φ and the quantified ψ explicitly.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
