Both reference '1.2' but node 1.2 is a LEMMA about generating cones, not the definition of M. The '1.2' in 1.1.1.1 appears to reference some EXTERNAL formula defining M as sums of a_i*a_i terms. This external reference (likely from Section 1 of the parent paper) must be properly imported via 'af add-external'.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
