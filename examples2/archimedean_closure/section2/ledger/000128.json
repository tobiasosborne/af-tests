However, the statement should explicitly indicate what property makes the form positive semidefinite. A more precise statement would be: 'By node 1.1.1.1, for all x in A_0, ⟨x,x⟩_φ = φ(x*x) \u003e= 0, which shows the sesquilinear form ⟨·,·⟩_φ is positive semidefinite.' This makes the logical structure explicit and connects the definition to the property.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
