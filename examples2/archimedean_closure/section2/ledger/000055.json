Is x,y ∈ A_0, or the entire *-algebra A, or some completion? (2) What is the codomain? Is it ℂ? (3) What is the underlying vector space structure? A *-algebra is NOT automatically a vector space over ℂ unless we specify the scalar field and verify the module structure.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
