For ||a||_M = sup_{ψ ∈ S_M} |ψ(a)| to be well-defined, we need S_M ≠ ∅. The proof of S_M ≠ ∅ appears in the Appendix (appendix_nonemptiness.md, Lemma A.1). This dependency is not declared. Without it, the supremum could be over an empty set, making it undefined (or -∞ by convention).","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
