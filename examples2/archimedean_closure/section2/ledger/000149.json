What exactly is S_M? The claim that phi(x*x) \u003e= 0 (from 1.1.1.1) depends critically on what S_M represents - presumably M-positive states. But without an explicit definition, we cannot verify that members of S_M satisfy the properties needed (positivity on M, linearity, *-preservation, etc.). The definition of S_M should either be in scope or explicitly referenced as an external/assumption.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
