What exactly is S_M? Is it the set of all states on A_0 that are M-positive? Is it the set of normalized M-positive functionals? Are these states required to be linear functionals? Are they assumed continuous with respect to some topology? The reader cannot evaluate this claim without knowing the precise definition of S_M.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
