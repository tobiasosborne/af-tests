Sesquilinearity requires: (1) Linearity in one argument (which one?), (2) Conjugate-linearity in the other. This requires PROVING that φ(x*(λy)) = λ·φ(x*y) and φ((λx)*y) = λ̄·φ(x*y) (or the opposite convention). This relies on φ being linear and the *-involution being conjugate-linear, neither of which is stated or proven here.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
