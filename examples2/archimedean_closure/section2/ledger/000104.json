This node only concludes that every self-adjoint element is a DIFFERENCE of two cone elements. Being a generating cone requires TWO properties: (1) M ∩ (A_0)_sa must be a CONE (closed under addition, closed under positive scalar multiplication, contains 0), and (2) the cone differences must generate (A_0)_sa. This proof ONLY addresses property (2) and completely ignores property (1). The cone axioms for M ∩ (A_0)_sa have never been verified.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
