This requires: (1) x*y must be in the domain of φ, (2) the product x*y must exist in the algebra for all x,y in the claimed domain, (3) the involution * must be defined on the domain. If the domain includes unbounded elements or the algebra is not complete, this could fail.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
