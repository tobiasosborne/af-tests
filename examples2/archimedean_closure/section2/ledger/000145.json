While the proof shows (A_0)_sa = (M ∩ (A_0)_sa) - (M ∩ (A_0)_sa), this is stronger than merely being a generating cone - it means the cone spans the entire space using only DIFFERENCES. Is this the intended meaning? Some definitions of 'generating' allow more general linear combinations.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
