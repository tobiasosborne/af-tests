In *-algebra notation, does this mean (x*)·y (the involution of x, then multiplied by y) or x·(y*) (x multiplied by the involution of y)? The standard convention for sesquilinear forms derived from states uses φ(x*·y) where * acts on the first argument, but this MUST be explicit. Different conventions lead to different linearity properties.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
