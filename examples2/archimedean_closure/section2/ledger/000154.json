What is the precise definition being used? Common definitions include: (i) C is a generating cone for V if V = C - C (algebraic span), (ii) C is a generating cone if span(C) = V, (iii) C generates V as a convex cone. These are NOT equivalent. The proof cannot be verified without knowing which definition is intended.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
