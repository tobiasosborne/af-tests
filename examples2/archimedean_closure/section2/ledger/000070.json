To conclude Lipschitz continuity with constant 1, we need |φ(a) - φ(b)| ≤ ||a - b||_M. This requires using linearity of φ: |φ(a) - φ(b)| = |φ(a - b)| ≤ ||a - b||_M. But the linearity of φ was never explicitly stated or invoked in this proof step. The inference 'Hence' is unjustified without this crucial step.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
