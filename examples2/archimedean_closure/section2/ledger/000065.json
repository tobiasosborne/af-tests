This is a normalization condition for states. While φ ∈ S_M suggests φ is an M-positive state, the condition φ(1) = 1 (or more generally, the definition of S_M including this normalization) has not been made explicit in the proof or its dependencies. This should either be stated as a dependency on a definition of S_M, or the step should explicitly note this property is being used.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
