However, the form ⟨·,·⟩_φ defined as ⟨x,y⟩_φ := φ(x*y) is only shown to be positive semidefinite (node 1.1.1.2), not necessarily sesquilinear. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for such forms requires that: (1) the form is sesquilinear (conjugate-linear in first argument, linear in second), and (2) positive semidefinite. Sesquilinearity of ⟨x,y⟩_φ = φ(x*y) needs φ to be linear and the involution * to satisfy (λx)* = λ̄x*. These properties have not been explicitly verified in scope.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
