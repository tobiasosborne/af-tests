Running 'af defs' returns 'No definitions found.' While node 1.2 exists, it states a LEMMA about M (that M ∩ (A_0)_sa is a generating cone), not a DEFINITION of M. The set M has never been formally defined. What is M? What elements does it contain? Without an explicit definition of M, the statement 'x*x ∈ M' is mathematically meaningless.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
