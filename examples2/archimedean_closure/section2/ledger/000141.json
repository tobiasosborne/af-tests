Is x an arbitrary element of A? Of A_0? Is x self-adjoint? The parent node 1.1.1 introduces a sesquilinear form ⟨x,y⟩_φ but doesn't constrain x. For the sesquilinear form to be well-defined and positive semidefinite, we need to know what algebra elements are being considered.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
