But node 1.3 is a SIBLING of 1.1, not a parent or prior result. Does 1.1 depend on 1.3? If so, this dependency must be explicit. If '1.3' refers to an external definition (not node 1.3), this should be clarified. Current structure suggests possible circular reasoning.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
