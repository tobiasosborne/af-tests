In Hilbert space theory, a sesquilinear form B is positive semidefinite if B(x,x) \u003e= 0 for all x. But here A_0 is a *-algebra over C, so phi(x*x) is a complex number in general\\! The claim 'phi(x*x) \u003e= 0' implicitly assumes phi(x*x) is in R for all x in A_0, which has not been established. We need either: (a) an explicit definition of 'positive semidefinite' for this context, or (b) a proof that phi(x*x) is real-valued.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
