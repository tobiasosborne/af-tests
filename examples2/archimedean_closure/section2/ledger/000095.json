The conclusion 'Hence' explicitly indicates this is an inference from prior steps. The node should declare dependency on 1.1.1.1. Furthermore, even with that dependency, the inference is incomplete - see the other challenges about sesquilinearity and real-valuedness requirements.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
