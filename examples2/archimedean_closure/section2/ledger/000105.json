What are 'the terms'? What is the formula in '1.2' that has these terms? If M is defined as something like M = {Σᵢ aᵢ*aᵢ : aᵢ ∈ A}, then the claim should explicitly state: 'Taking a₁ = x and aᵢ = 0 for i \u003e 1 in the definition M = {Σᵢ aᵢ*aᵢ : aᵢ ∈ A}, we get x*x ∈ M.' The current phrasing assumes the reader knows what '1.2' contains.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
