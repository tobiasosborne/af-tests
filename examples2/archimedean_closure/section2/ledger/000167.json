The proof uses 1 (identity element) in multiple places: phi(1) = 1, the form \u003c1, a\u003e, and N_a*1 - a*a in M. If A_0 lacks an identity element, these expressions are undefined. Is A_0 assumed unital? If not, does A_0 have an approximate identity? How would the proof adapt?","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
