The standard definition requires: (1) C is a convex cone (closed under positive scalar multiplication and addition), and (2) C is generating means V = C - C (every element is a difference of cone elements). Which definition is intended? Is the cone required to be proper (C ∩ (-C) = {0})? These properties need explicit statement.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
