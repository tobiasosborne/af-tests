Does this mean ((1+x)*) multiplied by (1+x), i.e., the involution applied before multiplication? Or does it mean (1+x) multiplied by (1+x), i.e., ordinary multiplication without involution? In standard *-algebra notation, a*a typically means (a*) times a, where a* is the involution. However, if x is self-adjoint (x* = x), then (1+x)* = 1* + x* = 1 + x, so (1+x)*(1+x) = (1+x)(1+x) = (1+x)^2. This interpretation must be made explicit.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
