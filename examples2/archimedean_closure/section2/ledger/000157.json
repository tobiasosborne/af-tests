The subproof in node 1.1.1.3 uses phi(1) = 1 to simplify phi(1)*phi(a*a) = phi(a*a). This assumes states in S_M are normalized. But this is never stated in the definition of S_M. Are elements of S_M required to satisfy phi(1) = 1? If not, the first inequality |phi(a)|^2 \u003c= phi(a*a) fails.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
