The proof context shows no definition of A_0 or its base field. If A_0 is a *-algebra over ℤ or ℤ₂, then 1/4 is undefined. This scalar arithmetic assumption must be made explicit in the scope or a dependency must reference a definition establishing A_0 as an algebra over an appropriate field.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
