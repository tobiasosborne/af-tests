With the definition ⟨x,y⟩_φ = φ(x*y), this requires φ(y*x) = φ(x*y)* for all x,y in A_0. This is equivalent to φ being a *-map (φ(a*) = φ(a)* for all a). This property is essential for Cauchy-Schwarz (used in node 1.1.1.3) to apply, but has not been established. Is φ assumed to be a *-linear functional? This must be explicit.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
