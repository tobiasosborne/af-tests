While this is standard for unital *-algebras, the algebraic structure A_0 and its unit element have not been formally defined in scope. Additionally, the notation x*y could be interpreted as: (1) multiplication of x* and y where * is the involution, or (2) some other binary operation. The intended interpretation (x*)·y for the sesquilinear form should be made explicit, and the existence of a unit 1 ∈ A_0 should be a dependency.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
