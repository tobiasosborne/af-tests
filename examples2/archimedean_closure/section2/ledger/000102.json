Even if (1+x)*(1+x) and (1-x)*(1-x) lie in M (per this node), the proof uses (1/4) times these elements. The claim that M contains a*a does NOT imply M contains (1/4)a*a unless M is closed under multiplication by positive scalars. This closure property is NEVER stated or proved. Is M a cone? Is it closed under R_+-multiplication? This must be explicit.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
