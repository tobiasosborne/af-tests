Node 1.2.1.3 claims (1+x)*(1+x) and (1-x)*(1-x) lie in M ∩ (A_0)_sa, but the conclusion requires (1/4)(1+x)*(1+x) and (1/4)(1-x)*(1-x) to lie in M ∩ (A_0)_sa. This requires that M ∩ (A_0)_sa is closed under multiplication by POSITIVE scalars. This cone property has never been established. Without showing M is closed under positive scalar multiplication, the conclusion does not follow.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
