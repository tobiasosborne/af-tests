From context (section 1), it appears to mean the self-adjoint elements of A_0 = C\u003cg_1,...,g_n\u003e, but this is never formally stated. The notation '_sa' needs explicit definition: Does (A_0)_sa := {a in A_0 : a* = a}? This definition is critical since the entire lemma depends on what (A_0)_sa means.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
