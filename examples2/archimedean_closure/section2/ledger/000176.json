At minimum, it should depend on: (1) the fact that 1 has an involution with 1* = 1, (2) the property that the involution distributes over addition: (a+b)* = a* + b*, and (3) the assumption from the parent node that x is self-adjoint. Without these dependencies, the node appears to be an unsupported assertion.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
