The claim implicitly relies on: (1) the definition of M as containing sums of a*a terms, (2) the algebra structure of A_0 (multiplication, addition, involution), (3) the existence of a unit element 1 in A_0. These dependencies must be explicitly declared or the missing definitions must be added to the proof.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
