This requires that φ is M-positive, meaning φ(m) ≥ 0 for all m ∈ M. However: (1) The property 'M-positive' or 'φ ∈ S_M' has never been formally defined in this proof. (2) Even if φ ∈ S_M is assumed (from parent node 1.1), the definition of S_M is missing. (3) The logical step 'm ∈ M implies φ(m) ≥ 0' is the core property being used but it is never stated as an assumption or definition in scope.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
