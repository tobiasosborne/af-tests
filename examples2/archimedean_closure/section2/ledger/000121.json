This requires Lemma 2.1 (Boundedness Lemma), which establishes |ψ(a)| ≤ √N_a for all ψ ∈ S_M. However, the current node appears in the proof of Corollary 2.4, which should FOLLOW Lemma 2.1, not assume its consequence. The dependency on 2.1 for finiteness should be explicit.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
