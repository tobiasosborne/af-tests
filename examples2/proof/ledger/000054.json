The M-seminorm ||A||_M = sup{|phi(A)|} being zero means A is in the kernel of all M-positive states, but this does not directly imply A is in closure(M). For self-adjoint elements, ||a||_M = 0 typically means a is in the intersection closure(M) ∩ (-closure(M)), not necessarily in closure(M) itself. Please clarify: (1) What is the precise definition of the M-seminorm being used? (2) Why does ||A||_M = 0 imply A is in closure(M) rather than just A being in the null cone of the seminorm?","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
