/-! # Main Theorem: Archimedean Closure Characterization

This file proves the main theorem of the formalization:

  A ∈ M̄ ⟺ A ≥ 0 in all constrained *-representations

## Main results

* `main_theorem` - The main characterization theorem

## Proof Structure

The proof chains three equivalences:
1. A ∈ M̄ ⟺ φ(A) ≥ 0 for all M-positive states (dual_characterization)
2. φ(A) ≥ 0 for all states ⟹ π(A) ≥ 0 for all reps (state_nonneg_implies_rep_positive)
3. π(A) ≥ 0 for all reps ⟹ φ(A) ≥ 0 for all states (gns_constrained_implies_state_nonneg)

/-- Main Theorem: A ∈ M̄ ⟺ A ≥ 0 in all constrained *-representations.

This characterizes positivity in constrained representations in terms of
membership in the closure of the quadratic module.

Note: We use universe level 0 for the Hilbert space to match the GNS construction. -/
