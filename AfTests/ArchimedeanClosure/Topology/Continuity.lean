/-! # State Continuity in Seminorm Topology

This file proves that M-positive states are continuous (in fact, Lipschitz)
with respect to the state seminorm topology.

## Main results

* `MPositiveState.lipschitz` - Every M-positive state is 1-Lipschitz
* `MPositiveState.continuous` - Every M-positive state is continuous

## Mathematical Background

For any M-positive state φ and any a, b:
  |φ(a) - φ(b)| = |φ(a - b)| ≤ ||a - b||_M

This is immediate from `MPositiveState.apply_abs_le_seminorm`.

/-- State evaluation at a point is subadditive bounded by the seminorm.

This is the key property for Lipschitz continuity. -/
