/-! # Seminorm Topology on FreeStarAlgebra

This file defines the topology on FreeStarAlgebra induced by the state seminorm,
and shows it is locally convex.

## Main definitions

* `stateSeminormFamily` - The state seminorm as a SeminormFamily (indexed by Unit)
* `seminormTopology` - TopologicalSpace induced by state seminorm

## Main results

* `withSeminorms_stateSeminormFamily` - The topology satisfies WithSeminorms
* `locallyConvexSpace_seminormTopology` - The topology is locally convex
* `quadraticModuleClosure_eq_closure` - ε-δ closure equals topological closure
* `isClosed_quadraticModuleClosure` - The closure M̄ is closed

## Purpose

This infrastructure enables using `ProperCone.hyperplane_separation_point` for
the Riesz extension theorem in AC-P6.4.
