/-! # Closedness of State Conditions

This file proves that the conditions defining M-positive states are closed
in the product topology on `FreeStarAlgebra n → ℝ`.

## Main results

* `isClosed_additivity` - Additive functions form a closed set
* `isClosed_homogeneity` - ℝ-homogeneous functions form a closed set
* `isClosed_star_symmetry` - Star-symmetric functions form a closed set
* `isClosed_m_nonneg` - M-nonnegative functions form a closed set
* `isClosed_normalized` - Functions with f(1)=1 form a closed set

## Proof Strategy

Each condition is expressed as a preimage of a closed set under a continuous map.
In the product topology, evaluation at a point is continuous, so:
- Equalities like f(a+b) = f(a) + f(b) are preimages of {0} under continuous maps
- Inequalities like f(m) ≥ 0 are preimages of [0,∞) under continuous evaluation

See LEARNINGS_misc.md for details on this approach.
