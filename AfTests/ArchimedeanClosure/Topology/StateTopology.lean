/-! # Topology on State Space

This file defines the weak-* topology (pointwise convergence) on M-positive states.

## Main definitions

* `MPositiveState.instTopologicalSpace` - Pointwise convergence topology on S_M

## Main results

* `MPositiveState.eval_continuous` - Evaluation at any element is continuous

## Mathematical Background

The topology on S_M is the subspace topology inherited from the weak-* topology
on the dual space. Concretely, a net φᵢ → φ iff φᵢ(a) → φ(a) for all a ∈ A₀.

/-- The pointwise convergence topology on M-positive states.

This is the coarsest topology making all evaluation maps continuous.
Equivalently, φᵢ → φ iff φᵢ(a) → φ(a) for all a. -/
