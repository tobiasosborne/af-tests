/-! # Closure of Quadratic Module

This file defines the closure of the quadratic module M in the ||·||_M topology.

## Main definitions

* `quadraticModuleClosure` - The closure of M in the seminorm topology

## Main results

* `quadraticModule_subset_closure` - M ⊆ M̄
* `closure_add_mem` - M̄ is closed under addition
* `closure_smul_mem` - M̄ is closed under nonnegative scalar multiplication
