# Lemma 5: Transitivity of H on Omega

The group H = ⟨g₁, g₂, g₃⟩ acts transitively on Ω = Fin(6+n+k+m).

## Main Results

* `H_isPretransitive` - H acts transitively on Omega

## Proof Strategy

The proof proceeds by showing the support graph Γ is connected:
1. Identify edges from each generator (consecutive elements in cycles)
2. Show the Core {0,1,2,3,4,5} forms a connected subgraph
3. Show each tail vertex connects to the Core
4. Conclude Γ is connected, hence H acts transitively

## Reference

See `examples/lemmas/lemma05_transitivity.md` for the natural language proof.

  obtain ⟨h₁, hh₁⟩ := H_reaches_core n k m x
  -- Get h₂ mapping y to some core element c₂
  obtain ⟨h₂, hh₂⟩ := H_reaches_core n k m y
  -- Get elements as Fin 6
  let c₁ : Fin 6 := ⟨(h₁.val x).val, hh₁⟩

  -- Use core_connected to get h₃ mapping c₁ to c₂
  obtain ⟨h₃, hh₃⟩ := core_connected n k m c₁ c₂

/-- The group H acts transitively on Omega.
    Proof: The support graph is connected (Core is connected and all tails
    connect to Core), hence H acts transitively. -/
