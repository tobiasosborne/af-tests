# Lemma 5: Tail Vertices Connect to Core

Each tail vertex (from generators g₁, g₂, g₃) connects to the Core {0,1,2,3,4,5}.

## Main Results

* `a_tail_connected_to_core` - a-tail elements connect to Core via g₁
* `b_tail_connected_to_core` - b-tail elements connect to Core via g₂
* `c_tail_connected_to_core` - c-tail elements connect to Core via g₃
* `H_reaches_core` - Any element can be mapped to a core element

    g₁ cycles through [0, 5, 3, 2, 6, 7, ..., 5+n], so
    g₁^(n-i) maps 6+i to 0 (in the Core). -/
