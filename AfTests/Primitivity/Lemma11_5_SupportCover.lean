# Lemma 11.5: Support Coverage

Proves that the supports of g₁, g₂, g₃ together cover all of Omega.

## Main Results

* `supports_cover_omega`: Every element of Ω is in at least one support
* `tailA_in_support_g₁`: Tail A elements are in supp(g₁)
* `tailB_in_support_g₂`: Tail B elements are in supp(g₂)
* `tailC_in_support_g₃`: Tail C elements are in supp(g₃)
