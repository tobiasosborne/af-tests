# GNS Uniqueness Theorem

The GNS representation is unique up to unitary equivalence.

## Main results

* `State.gns_uniqueness` - The GNS uniqueness theorem

## Mathematical Statement

Given any cyclic *-representation (H, π, ξ) with:
- π : A →⋆ₐ[ℂ] B(H) is a *-representation
- ‖ξ‖ = 1
- φ(a) = ⟨ξ, π(a)ξ⟩ for all a ∈ A
- {π(a)ξ : a ∈ A} is dense in H

There exists a unitary U : H_φ ≃ₗᵢ[ℂ] H such that:
- U(Ω_φ) = ξ
- U ∘ π_φ(a) = π(a) ∘ U for all a ∈ A

/-- **GNS Uniqueness Theorem**: The GNS representation is unique up to unitary equivalence.

Given any cyclic *-representation (H, π, ξ) satisfying the state condition φ(a) = ⟨ξ, π(a)ξ⟩
and cyclicity (the orbit {π(a)ξ : a ∈ A} is dense in H), there exists a unitary
U : H_φ ≃ₗᵢ[ℂ] H that:
1. Maps the canonical cyclic vector to ξ: U(Ω_φ) = ξ
2. Intertwines the representations: U ∘ π_φ(a) = π(a) ∘ U for all a ∈ A

This establishes that all cyclic *-representations implementing the same state are
unitarily equivalent to the GNS representation. -/
