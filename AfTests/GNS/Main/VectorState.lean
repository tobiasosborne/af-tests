# GNS Vector State Theorem

This file proves the fundamental GNS identity: φ(a) = ⟨Ω_φ, π_φ(a)Ω_φ⟩.

## Main results

* `State.gns_vector_state` - φ(a) = ⟪Ω_φ, gnsRep φ a Ω_φ⟫

## Mathematical Background

The GNS construction produces a Hilbert space H_φ, a representation π_φ : A → B(H_φ),
and a cyclic vector Ω_φ. The key identity is that the original state φ can be
recovered as a vector state:

  φ(a) = ⟨Ω_φ, π_φ(a)Ω_φ⟩

This shows that every state arises from a vector state in some representation.

### Proof sketch
- π_φ(a)Ω_φ = [a·1] = [a] by definition of the representation
- ⟨Ω_φ, [a]⟩ = ⟨[1], [a]⟩ = φ(1*·a) = φ(a)

/-- **The GNS Vector State Theorem**: φ(a) = ⟪Ω_φ, π_φ(a)Ω_φ⟫.

This is the fundamental identity of the GNS construction, showing that every
state on a C*-algebra can be represented as a vector state. -/

/-- Alternative formulation: the representation recovers the state. -/
