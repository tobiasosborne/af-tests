# Lemma 6: Commutator [g₁, g₂] Contains 3-Cycles

The commutator [g₁, g₂] = g₁⁻¹ g₂⁻¹ g₁ g₂ is a product of two disjoint 3-cycles.

## Main Results

* `commutator_g₁_g₂` - Definition of the commutator [g₁, g₂]
* `commutator_g₁_g₂_base_case_eq` - In base case: [g₁, g₂] = (0 2 4)(1 3 5)
* `commutator_g₁_g₂_has_3cycles` - The commutator contains 3-cycles

## Proof Strategy

Direct computation using `native_decide` for the base case n=k=m=0.
The commutator of two permutations that don't commute produces elements
of smaller support, yielding two disjoint 3-cycles.

## Reference

See `examples/lemmas/lemma06_commutator_g1g2.md` for the natural language proof.

-- BASE CASE ANALYSIS: Individual 3-cycles NOT in H₆
-- ============================================

/-! ### Important: Base Case Structure

In the base case (n=k=m=0), H₆ ≅ S₄ with |H₆| = 24 (Lemma 3-4).
H₆ preserves the block structure B₀ = {{0,3}, {1,4}, {2,5}} (Lemma 1-3).

The individual 3-cycles c[0,2,4] and c[1,3,5] are NOT in H₆ because they
break this block structure:
- c[0,2,4] maps Block1 = {0,3} to {2,3}, which is not a block
- c[1,3,5] maps Block2 = {1,4} to {3,4}, which is not a block

The PRODUCT c[0,2,4] * c[1,3,5] = [g₁,g₂] IS in H₆, but the individual
cycles cannot be extracted in the base case.

For the general case (n+k+m ≥ 1), the Main Theorem uses a different strategy:
squaring (c₁₂ * c₁₃⁻¹)² eliminates 2-cycles and yields a single 3-cycle.
See MainTheorem.lean for the correct 3-cycle extraction. -/
