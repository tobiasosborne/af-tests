# Three-Cycle Extraction Proof

Proves that (c₁₂ * c₁₃⁻¹)² is a 3-cycle for all n ≥ 1, k when m = 0.

## Main Result

* `sq_isThreeCycle_n_ge1_m0` - The squared product is a 3-cycle

## Strategy

The proof shows that the squared product equals `threeCycle_0_5_1 n k`, which is
already proven to be a 3-cycle in ThreeCycleExtractHelpers.

The equality is proven by showing both permutations agree on all elements:
- Core elements {0,1,2,3,4,5}: Determined by generator structure
- Tail elements ≥ 6: Fixed by structural argument (see TailLemmas)
