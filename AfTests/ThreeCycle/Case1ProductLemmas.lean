# Product Lemmas for Case 1: m ≥ 1, k = 0

Single-application and squared-action lemmas for (c₁₃ * c₂₃⁻¹) when k = 0.

## Key Results

When k = 0, g₂ = formPerm [1, 3, 4, 0] (no tail).
The product (c₁₃ * c₂₃⁻¹) has cycle type with a 3-cycle on {3, 4, 5}.
Squaring eliminates 2-cycles, leaving threeCycle_3_4_5.

## Computational Verification

The single application values are:
- prod(3) = 5
- prod(4) = 3
- prod(5) = 4
