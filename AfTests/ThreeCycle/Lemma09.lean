# Lemma 9: 3-Cycle Extraction

Extract 3-cycles from products of commutators. We compute c₁₂ * c₁₃⁻¹ where:
- c₁₂ = [g₁, g₂] (from Lemma 6)
- c₁₃ = [g₁, g₃] (from Lemma 7)

## Main Results

* `c₁₂_times_c₁₃_inv` - The product c₁₂ * c₁₃⁻¹
* `c₁₂_times_c₁₃_inv_base_case_eq` - In base case: c₁₂ * c₁₃⁻¹ = (0 1 5)(2 3 4)
* `c₁₂_times_c₁₃_inv_mem_H` - The product is in H

## Proof Strategy

Direct computation using `native_decide` for the base case n=k=m=0.
The product c₁₂ * c₁₃⁻¹ is a product of two disjoint 3-cycles.

## Reference

See `examples/lemmas/lemma09_3cycle_extraction.md` for the natural language proof.

-- BASE CASE ANALYSIS: Individual 3-cycles NOT in H₆
-- ============================================

/-! ### Important: Base Case Structure

In the base case (n=k=m=0), H₆ ≅ S₄ with |H₆| = 24 (Lemma 3-4).
H₆ preserves the block structure B₀ = {{0,3}, {1,4}, {2,5}} (Lemma 1-3).

The individual 3-cycles c[0,1,5] and c[2,3,4] are NOT in H₆ because they
break this block structure:
- c[0,1,5] maps Block1 = {0,3} to {1,3}, which is not a block
- c[2,3,4] maps Block3 = {2,5} to {3,5}, which is not a block

The PRODUCT c[0,1,5] * c[2,3,4] = c₁₂ * c₁₃⁻¹ IS in H₆, but the individual
cycles cannot be extracted in the base case.

For the general case (n+k+m ≥ 1), the Main Theorem uses a different strategy:
squaring (c₁₂ * c₁₃⁻¹)² eliminates 2-cycles and yields a single 3-cycle.
See MainTheorem.lean for the correct 3-cycle extraction. -/
