# Lemma 7: Commutator [g₁, g₃] Contains 3-Cycles

The commutator [g₁, g₃] = g₁⁻¹ g₃⁻¹ g₁ g₃ is a product of two disjoint 3-cycles.

## Main Results

* `commutator_g₁_g₃` - Definition of the commutator [g₁, g₃]
* `commutator_g₁_g₃_base_case_eq` - In base case: [g₁, g₃] = (0 4 5)(1 2 3)
* `commutator_g₁_g₃_has_3cycles` - The commutator contains 3-cycles

## Proof Strategy

Direct computation using `native_decide` for the base case n=k=m=0.
The commutator of two permutations that don't commute produces elements
of smaller support, yielding two disjoint 3-cycles.

## Reference

See `examples/lemmas/lemma07_commutator_g1g3.md` for the natural language proof.

/-! ### Important: Base Case Structure

In the base case (n=k=m=0), H₆ ≅ S₄ with |H₆| = 24 (Lemma 3-4).
H₆ preserves the block structure B₀ = {{0,3}, {1,4}, {2,5}} (Lemma 1-3).

The individual 3-cycles c[0,4,5] and c[1,2,3] are NOT in H₆ because they
break this block structure:
- c[0,4,5] maps Block1 = {0,3} to {3,4}, which is not a block
- c[1,2,3] maps Block2 = {1,4} to {2,4}, which is not a block

The PRODUCT c[0,4,5] * c[1,2,3] = [g₁,g₃] IS in H₆, but the individual
cycles cannot be extracted in the base case.

For the general case (n+k+m ≥ 1), the Main Theorem uses a different strategy:
squaring (c₁₂ * c₁₃⁻¹)² eliminates 2-cycles and yields a single 3-cycle.
See MainTheorem.lean for the correct 3-cycle extraction. -/
