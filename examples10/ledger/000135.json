These are immediate isomorphisms from the permutation line: H_{c3} ~ H_{c5} and H_{c4} ~ H_{c6}. While arguably trivial from S_2 symmetry, the paper treats them as part of the lasso analysis, and the node's claim of 'all inter-Hilbert-space maps' should include them or explicitly note their delegation to node 1.5.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
