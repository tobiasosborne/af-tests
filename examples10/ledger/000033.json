This is sufficient since the other root (1-sqrt(5))/2 is negative and quantum dimensions are positive. However, the stronger constraint from unitarity/reflection positivity is d(tau) \u003e= 1 (paper section 2.1.5), which also rules out the other solution. The proof is correct but the justification could be made more precise by citing the unitarity/positivity constraint rather than just 'positive root', since in principle one should explain WHY the positive root is selected (the answer being: unitary fusion categories require d(i) \u003e= 1).","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
