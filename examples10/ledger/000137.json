The paper also confirms 52 total irreps reduce to 22 independent ones (line 2848), which is verified by counting: H_{c1}=5, H_{c2}=4, H_{c3}=7, H_{c4}=6, H_{c5}=7, H_{c6}=6, H_{c7}=9, H_{c8}=8, total=52. The Drinfeld center table (lines 2849-2873) has exactly 22 entries (2+2+2+2+1+2+2+4+4+1=22). The node correctly identifies the main structure.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
