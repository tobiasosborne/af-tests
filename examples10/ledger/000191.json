Paper line 2831 states that the four lassos L^(11)--L^(14) from c_4\u003c-\u003ec_8 implement H_{c4}^(3)~H_{c8}^(2,-1), H_{c4}^(4)~H_{c8}^(2,1), H_{c4}^(5)~H_{c8}^(3,-1), H_{c4}^(6)~H_{c8}^(3,1). Since H_{c4}~H_{c6} (from node 1.5 / paper line 2680), this also yields H_{c6}^(3)~H_{c8}^(2,-1) etc., visible in the Drinfeld center table line 2868 where c_4+c_6+c_8 appears. The node's description '{c_2,c_4}\u003c-\u003ec_8' does not mention that c_6 is implicitly included in the c_8 lasso analysis (the hermitian conjugate maps from c_4\u003c-\u003ec_8 involve c_5 and c_6 explicitly, per lines 2822-2830). The c_8 lassos from c_4 actually involve anyon lines from c_3, c_4, c_5, c_6, c_7, c_8 — they are not a simple {c_2,c_4}\u003c-\u003ec_8 relation but involve all the permutation-twisted sectors.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
