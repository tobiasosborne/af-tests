The paper (arXiv:2602.06117) uses jheppub with numberwithin{equation}{section}. Counting numbered equations in Section 2 of fib2s2.tex: what nodes call 'eq 2.8' (general tube algebra formula, label algebra_Lasso at line 173) is actually eq 2.14; 'eq 2.7' (untwisted projectors, label projectors_untwistedFib at line 199) is actually eq 2.18; 'eqs 2.10-2.12' (structure constants, labels algebraFib2/3/4 at lines 224-228) are actually eqs 2.21-2.23; 'eq 2.13' (twisted projectors, label ProjectorsTwistedFib at line 246) is actually eq 2.24; and 'eq 2.16' in child 1.2.7 (general projector formula, label projectorsInGeneral at line 254) is actually eq 2.25. The mathematical CONTENT is correct in every case -- only equation numbers are wrong. This does not affect mathematical validity but should be corrected for accurate cross-referencing.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
