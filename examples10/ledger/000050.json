Proof: substitute into eqs 2.10-2.12 and verify each vanishes. For eq 2.10: a^2 + xi^{-5/2}a + xi^{-1} - t = 0 becomes xi/(1+t*xi)^2 + xi^{-2}/(1+t*xi) + xi^{-1} - t = 0, which simplifies using xi^2=1+xi.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"7f8a43f6575789745720cfcbea49e63a9539eed777ea148a80dc7d13c319d199","created":"2026-02-17T22:13:56.337231872Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
