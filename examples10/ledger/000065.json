Since T is diagonal with entries {1, 1, omega, omega*} where omega = e^{4pi*i/5}, and S^2 = I, we need STS*T*ST = I. This is equivalent to the modular relation in SL(2,Z). Verified by explicit matrix multiplication.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"26a5f5f602122439f5b56a3c7278b11afeb05462fc9cbe33a00555eee4d5d1a7","created":"2026-02-17T22:15:00.433431147Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
