The paper computes the tube algebra representations, minimal central idempotents, lasso maps, and the 22-by-22 modular S matrix for the fusion category (Fib x Fib) ⋊ S_2. We verify: (1) Fibonacci F-symbols, (2) tube algebra structure constants, (3) all irreducible representations in each twisted Hilbert space, (4) all minimal central idempotents, (5) inter-Hilbert-space lasso maps, (6) Drinfeld center identification, (7) the 22-by-22 modular S and T matrices, (8) consistency: S^2=C, (ST)^3=C. Each claim is verified both algebraically and numerically (using TensorCategories.jl).","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"d24785008404255ca28d3fd6a05b7d76e4890e8ea6627a8ffe6c9913a4723cf7","created":"2026-02-17T21:59:58.226460582Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
