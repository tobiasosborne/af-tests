The nontriviality is only established via the composition results in nodes 1.3.1-1.3.2. Either (a) the statement should be weakened to say 'can only act nontrivially on' (matching the paper's phrasing) or (b) an explicit dependency on 1.3.1/1.3.2 should be added.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
