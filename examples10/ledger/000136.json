The paper's 'Further lassos' section (lines 2674-2844) contains five distinct sub-analyses, each with explicit lasso map formulas, kernel/cokernel computations, and isomorphism results. The specific isomorphisms established are: (1) c_1\u003c-\u003ec_3: H_1^(3)~H_{c3}^(6), H_1^(4)~H_{c3}^(7), Z_1^(5)=2*Z_{c3}^(1) [the 'strange' 2d-to-1d intertwiner]; (2) c_1\u003c-\u003ec_7: H_1^(3)~H_{c7}^(0,1), H_1^(4)~H_{c7}^(0,-1); (3) c_3\u003c-\u003ec_7: H_{c3}^(6)~H_{c7}^(0,1), H_{c3}^(7)~H_{c7}^(0,-1), Z_{c7}^(8)=2*Z_{c3}^(5), Z_{c7}^(7)=2*Z_{c3}^(3); (4) c_2\u003c-\u003ec_4: H_p^(1)~H_{c4}^(1), H_p^(2)~H_{c4}^(2); (5) {c_2,c_4}\u003c-\u003ec_8: six 1d isomorphisms plus two 2d-to-1d intertwiners, culminating in H_{c8}~H_{c2} union H_{c4}. The node should either enumerate these specific results or be refined into sub-nodes.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
