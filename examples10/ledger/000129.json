Section 4 uses numberwithin{equation}{section} and has 22 numbered equations (4.1-4.22). The c_8 one-dim projectors are eq 4.20 (TeX line 2659), the T condition is eq 4.21 (line 2665), and the 2D projectors are eq 4.22 (line 2669). All mathematical content is correct: 14 networks confirmed (paper line 2606, enumerated from tables at lines 2638/2649), 6 one-dim irreps confirmed (3 solutions x 2 q-values), 2 two-dim irreps confirmed (paper line 2662), dimension check 6+2*4=14 verified algebraically.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
