Paper lines 2781-2783 show that L^(3)/L^(4) map the 2d Hilbert space H_{c7}^(8) to two copies of the 1d space H_{c3}^(5), yielding Z_{c7}^(8) = 2*Z_{c3}^(5). Similarly, L^(5)/L^(6) give Z_{c7}^(7) = 2*Z_{c3}^(3). These are NOT isomorphisms in the standard sense — they are 2d-to-1d morphisms with non-trivial kernel structure (the lasso from the 2d side has a rank-1 image in the 1d space). The node's blanket claim 'verify kernel/cokernel structure and Hilbert space isomorphisms' misclassifies these as isomorphisms when they are in fact rank-deficient intertwiners. The paper explicitly says (line 2783): 'maps the two-dimensional Hilbert space H_{c7}^(8) into two copies of the one-dimensional Hilbert space H_{c3}^(5)' — the 'strange intertwiner' structure from subsubsection 4.1.1 applies here too. The node must distinguish true isomorphisms from these anomalous 2d\u003c-\u003e1d relations.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
