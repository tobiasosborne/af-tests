{"type":"node_validated","timestamp":"2026-02-18T10:57:23.557210267Z","node_id":"1.10","note":"VERIFIED against paper source fib2s2.tex. All mathematical claims correct: (1) 18 networks confirmed (9 without + 9 with permutation line, paper line 2507 and tables at lines 2536, 2576). (2) 6 one-dim irreps from 3 spins x 2 parities (lines 2532-2583). (3) 3 two-dim irreps P^(7,8,9) (lines 2598-2603). (4) Dimension check 6+3*4=18 correct. (5) Projector formula at line 2584 contains all 18 networks. (6) Decomposition into Fib x Fib products at lines 2590-2603 confirmed. MINOR ISSUE: Equation numbers 4.21/4.22 should be 4.11/4.12/4.13 (challenge ch-14d1b7f7ec21c75b)."}
