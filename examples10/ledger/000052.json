The projectors are constructed via the general formula eq 2.16 with characters chi^{(Gamma)} from the eigenvalue table.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"22f601852f508d0cb3fede99273b32f8c50449f6294a30606db635bda20ca0b8","created":"2026-02-17T22:13:56.337244338Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
