{"type":"node_validated","timestamp":"2026-02-18T10:46:18.892259319Z","node_id":"1.7","note":"VERIFIED against paper Section 4.2 (lines 2060-2155 of fib2s2.tex).\n\n1. NETWORK COUNT: Paper line 2061 states \"four possible networks\" for H_{c_2}. The four networks are id_p, T_p, L_p^{c_7 c_8}, L_p^{c_8 c_7} (lines 2128-2131). CONFIRMED: 4 networks.\n\n2. IRREP COUNT AND DIMENSIONS: Paper line 2137 states \"solutions are all one-dimensional.\" The eigenvalue table (lines 2140-2147) lists exactly 4 irreps labeled (1)-(4). CONFIRMED: 4 one-dimensional irreps.\n\n3. DIMENSION CONSISTENCY: sum_Gamma (dim Gamma)^2 = 4 * 1^2 = 4 = |networks|. CONFIRMED.\n\n4. PROJECTORS: Four explicit projector formulas given in lines 2150-2155 (eqs for P_p^{(1)} through P_p^{(4)}). VERIFIED NUMERICALLY:\n   - Each projector evaluates to delta_{ij} on the irrep eigenvalues (orthogonality + idempotency).\n   - Sum of all 4 projectors equals id_p (completeness).\n\n5. INTERNAL CONSISTENCY: L_p^{c_8 c_7} = T_p * L_p^{c_7 c_8} confirmed from eigenvalue table. T_p eigenvalues +/-1 correctly give integer/half-integer spin.\n\n6. DRINFELD CENTER: All 4 projectors accounted for in Drinfeld center table (lines 2858, 2860).\n\nNo errors or gaps found. Node is COMPLETE as a leaf."}
