The lasso maps connect projectors and irreps defined in those individual Hilbert spaces. For example, the c_1\u003c-\u003ec_3 lasso analysis (paper lines 2693-2755) uses projectors P_1^{(3)}, P_1^{(4)}, P_1^{(5)} from H_{c1} and P_{c3}^{(1)}, P_{c3}^{(6)}, P_{c3}^{(7)} from H_{c3}.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
