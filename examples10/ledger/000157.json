It logically depends on: (1) nodes 1.3.1 and 1.3.2 (the lasso composition eqs 2.19-2.20, which show the lassos are mutual inverses on the relevant subspaces), and (2) nodes 1.2.6 and 1.2.7 (the projector definitions that define the 2+3=5 sectors). These should ideally be declared as explicit dependencies. However, this is a bookkeeping issue, not a mathematical error — the logical chain is sound.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
