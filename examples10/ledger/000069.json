Eqs (2.19)-(2.20) are actually the definition of twisted sector operators (id_tau, T_tau, L_tau^{tau tau}) and the Dehn twist (T_tau = e^{2 pi i P_tau}). Verified by counting all numbered equation/align environments from Section 2 start (TeX line 66) using jheppub.sty numberwithin{equation}{section}, accounting for all \\nn (nonumber) tags. The TeX labels Lasso1tau and Lassotau1 are at lines 284 and 286.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
