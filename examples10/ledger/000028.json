For the fusion ring {1,tau} with tau x tau = 1 + tau, the pentagon equations have two gauge-inequivalent solutions: the Fibonacci category and the Yang-Lee category (its complex conjugate). The full definition requires specifying the F-symbols. However, the fusion rule itself is correctly stated as an axiom and 'by definition' is acceptable for adopting this rule. The imprecision is that 'defining property' overstates what the fusion rule alone determines.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
