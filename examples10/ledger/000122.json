The node claims 12, which is off by a factor of 2.\n\n(2) IRREP COUNT IS WRONG: The paper gives exactly 6 one-dimensional solutions (table rows (1)-(6), lines 2488-2493) and states at line 2496: \"We therefore have six one-dimensional projectors.\" There is NO two-dimensional representation in the c_4 Hilbert space. The section runs from line 2341 to line 2504 with no mention of any two-dimensional irrep. The node erroneously claims \"1 two-dim irrep\".\n\nCORRECT STATEMENT should be: \"Twisted c_4 Hilbert space: 6 networks, 6 one-dim irreps (6x1^2=6), 6 projectors (eq after line 2497).\"\n\nThe dimension formula is consistent: 6 x 1^2 = 6 = number of networks.\n\nThe node's claimed dimension mismatch \"6+4=10 != 12\" is an artifact of both the network count AND the irrep count being fabricated. The correct numbers are entirely consistent: 6 = 6.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
