All mathematical content matches paper fib2s2.tex exactly. Two minor challenges raised: (1) ch-488ee3ddb1d: systematic equation number errors (all off by ~6-10) but content correct; (2) ch-ab454f6bdd5: missing dependency on node 1.1. Verified: general formula (line 174), structure constants (lines 225-229), eigenvalue table (lines 234-243), untwisted projectors (lines 200-203), twisted projectors (lines 247-249). Spot-checked projector idempotency algebraically and numerically."}
