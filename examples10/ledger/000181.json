PRIMARY SOURCE: paper/fib2s2.tex, Section 4, lines 2341-2504.\n\nERROR 1 - NETWORK COUNT WRONG: Line 2342 explicitly states 'In the twisted c_4 = (tau,1,p) Hilbert space there are six simple networks.' The eigenvalue table header at line 2486 lists exactly 6 generators: {id_{c4}, T_{c4}, T^{-1}_{c4}, T^2_{c4}, L_{c4}^{c8c7}, L_{c4}^{c7c8}}. The node claims 12, which is wrong by a factor of 2.\n\nERROR 2 - IRREP STRUCTURE WRONG: The solution table at lines 2488-2493 has exactly 6 rows (1)-(6), every row with leading entry 1 in the id_{c4} column, confirming all are 1-dimensional. Line 2496 reads 'We therefore have six one-dimensional projectors.' The entire section (lines 2341-2504) contains no two-dimensional representation. The node's claim of '1 two-dim irrep (6+4=10)' is fabricated.\n\nCORRECT FACTS: 6 simple networks, 6 one-dimensional irreps, dimension sum 6x1^2 = 6 = network count. Consistent. HANDOFF.md table also records H_{c4}: 6 networks, 6x1^2=6 correctly.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
