Statement coverage is complete: fusion rules (1.1.1), quantum dimensions (1.1.2), F-symbols eq 2.6 (1.1.3), total dimension (1.1.4). F-matrix [[1/xi,1/sqrt(xi)],[1/sqrt(xi),-1/xi]] confirmed against paper source lines 134-137. All mathematical claims independently verified: xi^2=1+xi holds exactly, F^2=I to machine precision, D^2=(5+sqrt(5))/2. Numerical TensorCategories.jl evidence attached. 6 outstanding challenges on children are all minor severity and non-blocking; they concern dependency declarations and minor precision of justifications, not mathematical correctness. No blocking issues found."}
