The prefactor 1/(2D^2) is correct. S^2=I to machine precision (8.7e-16). (ST)^3=I to machine precision (1.8e-15). However, the node omits a critical structural fact: the S matrix is NOT unitary (||SS^dagger - I|| = 2.23) and NOT symmetric (||S - S^T|| = 1.7). The asymmetry is entirely concentrated in row/column 22 (Z_{c7}^{(9)}), where row 22 off-diagonal entries are exactly 4x the corresponding column 22 entries. This factor-4 discrepancy arises because P_{c7}^{(9)} is a 2-dimensional tube algebra projector (paper line 2598-2602: 'three additional two-dimensional projectors'; line 2872 table: X = 2c_7 for P_{c7}^{(9)}). Rescaling: S_corr[22,j] = S[22,j]/2 and S_corr[j,22] = S[j,22]*2 yields a matrix that is both symmetric (||S_corr - S_corr^T|| \u003c 1e-15) and unitary (||S_corr S_corr^dagger - I|| \u003c 1e-15) and satisfies S_corr^2=I and (ST_corr)^3=I. The correct quantum dimension d[22] = S_corr[22,1]/S_corr[1,1] = 2*xi^2, consistent with a 2-dim irrep with underlying object 2*c_7. The node should acknowledge that the paper presents S in a non-orthonormal partition-function basis for Z_{c7}^{(9)}, and that the unitary symmetric modular S matrix requires a rescaling of row/col 22.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
