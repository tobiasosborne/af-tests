The 4x4 Fibonacci S matrix is equation 2.55 (label SmatrixFib, line 656). The mathematical content (S matrix entries, T matrix, S^2=C, (ST)^3=C) is all correct - only the equation number is wrong. This is a systematic issue noted in the proof tree instructions: the prover likely used draft numbering.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
