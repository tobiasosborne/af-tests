The asymmetry is entirely in row/column 22\n(the Z_{c_7}^{(9)} sector): S[22,i]/S[i,22] = 4 for all nonzero pairs.\n\nRoot cause: Z_{c_7}^{(9)} is the only 2-dimensional representation remaining\nin the basis (all others were eliminated via lasso maps). The trace over the\n2d rep introduces a factor of 2 relative to the 1d sectors. A basis rescaling\nD = diag(1,...,1,1/2) produces a perfectly symmetric and unitary matrix while\npreserving S^2=I and (ST)^3=I.\n\nThe node statement says 'verify S^2=C and (ST)^3=C' which IS satisfied.\nBut the statement omits verification of symmetry (S=S^T) and unitarity (SS^T=I),\nwhich are standard requirements for modular S matrices of modular tensor\ncategories. The node should be refined to address:\n(a) The basis normalization issue for the 22nd sector\n(b) Whether the paper's convention is intentional or an error\n(c) Explicit verification of symmetry and unitarity after normalization","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
