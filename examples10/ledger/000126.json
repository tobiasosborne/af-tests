The node says 'projectors (eq 4.21)' but the projector formula P_{c_7}^{(s,q)} is at TeX source line 2584. Using jheppub.sty's numberwithin{equation}{section} (line 313 of jheppub.sty), I counted all 13 numbered equations in Section 4 up through the c_7 subsection. The projector formula is equation 4.11 (not 4.21). Similarly, the 'decomposition into Fib x Fib projectors' cited as 'eq 4.22' actually consists of equations 4.12 (diagonal Fib products, label projc7, TeX line 2590) and 4.13 (two-dimensional mixed products, TeX line 2599). The mathematical content referenced by these equation numbers is correct — only the equation numbers themselves are wrong.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
