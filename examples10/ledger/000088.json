The paper gives the general F-symbol formula at eq 3.23 (label FsymbolsCG, line 1862): F^{(i,a)(j,b)(m,e)}_{(k,c)(l,d)(n,f)} = F^{phi_e(i) phi_{b*}(j) m}_{k phi_c(l) phi_{b*}(n)} * F^{abe}_{cdf}, factoring into a C-factor and a G-factor. The node should cite this equation.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
