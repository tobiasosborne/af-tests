All 4 children validated: (1.4.1) S matrix entries match paper eq 2.55, (1.4.2) T matrix matches paper line 652, (1.4.3) S^2=I verified numerically and analytically, (1.4.4) (ST)^3=I verified numerically. The only issue is wrong equation reference (2.37 should be 2.55) which is a known systematic numbering error from draft. S is real, symmetric, unitary. C=I since all Z(Fib) objects are self-dual."}
