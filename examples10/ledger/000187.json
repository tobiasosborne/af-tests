Annihilation claims (L_{tau\u003c-1} kills H_1^{(1)}, L_{1\u003c-tau} kills H_tau^{(2)} and H_tau^{(3)}) are verified independently via tube algebra using eq 2.8 with F-symbols: L_{tau\u003c-1}^{tt} x tau = (-1/xi)*L_{tau\u003c-1}^{tt}, yielding L_{tau\u003c-1} x P_1^{(1)} = 0 and L_{tau\u003c-1} x P_1^{(2)} = L_{tau\u003c-1}. Nontriviality claims are logically correct given validated nodes 1.3.1 and 1.3.2. Two open challenges (ch-9b449596b26, ch-8beb865070efaa94) document the missing dependency declarations -- both minor bookkeeping issues, not mathematical errors. No new mathematical errors found beyond the known dependency gap."}
