ALGEBRAIC VERIFICATION (verifier-s4): The kernel analysis has two distinct logical parts requiring different hypotheses. PART 1 (Annihilation, proved by tube algebra alone): Using eq 2.8, L_{tau\u003c-1}^{tt} x tau = (-1/xi)*L_{tau\u003c-1}^{tt} via F-symbols (coefficient = sqrt(xi)*(1/sqrt(xi))*(-1/xi)*1 = -1/xi). Therefore L_{tau\u003c-1} x P_1^{(1)} = (1/(1+xi^2))*(1 + xi*(-1/xi))*L_{tau\u003c-1} = 0. Annihilation of H_1^{(1)} is proved. Similarly L_{1\u003c-tau} x P_tau^{(2)} = 0 and L_{1\u003c-tau} x P_tau^{(3)} = 0 by analogous tube algebra computations. PART 2 (Nontriviality, requires compositions): L_{tau\u003c-1} x P_1^{(2)} = L_{tau\u003c-1} only shows support on H_1^{(2)}, not nonzero action. Nontriviality of L_{tau\u003c-1} on H_1^{(2)} and of L_{1\u003c-tau} on H_tau^{(1)} follows only from the nonzero composition results in nodes 1.3.2 and 1.3.1 respectively. This is the gap the paper acknowledges at TeX line 282 and the existing challenge ch-9b449596b26 flags. This verifier concurs and adds: the algebraic computation via F-symbols confirms the annihilation claims are self-contained, but the nontriviality claims create an undeclared dependency on 1.3.1/1.3.2.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
