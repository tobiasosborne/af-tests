The node OMITS the important fact that P_1^(5) has NO direct c_1\u003c-\u003ec_7 lasso connection: the paper states there are only two lasso maps (L^(1) and L^(2)) between c_1 and c_7 (lines 2759-2769), covering only the 1d sectors H_1^(3) and H_1^(4). The 2d sector H_1^(5) is NOT connected to c_7 via this pair of lassos. The node description 'verify kernel/cokernel structure' is generic but the paper actually establishes isomorphisms (trivial kernel and cokernel) for the 1d-to-1d cases and the anomalous 2d-to-1d intertwiners (Z_1^(5)=2*Z_{c3}^(1)) only for the c_1\u003c-\u003ec_3 case, not for c_1\u003c-\u003ec_7.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
