Child node 1.2.1 explicitly references 'the Fib F-matrix from node 1.1.3'. Nodes 1.2.2-1.2.4 require the F-symbol values from eq:FFib (node 1.1.3) to derive the structure constants. Node 1.2.6 requires the fusion rule tau x tau = 1 + tau (node 1.1.1). This dependency should be declared for proof-tree completeness.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
