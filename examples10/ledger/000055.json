Apply the general tube algebra formula with i=1, s=tau, i'=1, j=j'=k=k'=tau. The result is proportional to P_1^{(2)} because P_1^{(2)} projects onto the eigenspace where tau acts with eigenvalue -1/xi.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"9e7dfe31f6f0cfa6331eac39a0addbc36649700af8167f4289c7e4b45c538337","created":"2026-02-17T22:14:33.034121588Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
