ERROR 1 — Wrong network count: The node claims '10 networks' but the paper states explicitly at line 2158: 'It admits seven simple networks: id_{c_3}, T_{c_3}, L_{c_3}^{c_3 c_3}, L_{c_3}^{c_5 c_7}, L_{c_3}^{c_7 c_5}, L_{c_3}^{c_7 c_7}, L_{c_3}^{c_8 c_8}.' That is exactly 7 networks, not 10. ERROR 2 — Wrong irrep structure: The node claims '3 one-dim + 2 two-dim irreps' but the paper states at line 2315: 'There are seven different one-dimensional solutions of the corresponding algebra.' All 7 irreps are one-dimensional; there are NO two-dimensional irreps in H_{c_3}. The correct dimension check is 7 x 1^2 = 7, which matches the 7 networks exactly (confirmed in HANDOFF.md). The projectors in the paper (eq 4.11, lines 2316-2338) give 7 minimal central idempotents P_{c_3}^{(1)} through P_{c_3}^{(7)}, all one-dimensional. The '3+2*4=11 -\u003e recheck' flag in the node does not indicate an honest uncertainty about a valid structure — it is internally inconsistent arithmetic arising from a completely wrong irrep assignment. The node must be rewritten: 7 networks, 7 one-dim irreps, dimension check 7x1^2=7.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
