More precisely, the pentagon equations alone over-determine the system but in combination with the normalization conventions from bubble moves (part a). The pentagon + normalization together uniquely fix F up to gauge for the Fibonacci fusion ring. This is a well-known result (see e.g. Kitaev 2006, Appendix E). The two distinct Fibonacci-type modular tensor categories (Fib and its complex conjugate) share the same F-symbols but differ in their R-matrices (braiding). So the statement is correct but slightly imprecise about which constraints contribute.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
