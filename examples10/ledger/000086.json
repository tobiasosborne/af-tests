The correct references are: (a) Deligne product fusion rules = eq 3.4; (b) Semidirect product fusion rules = eq 3.17 (label junctionsemidirect, line 1104): (i,a) x (j,b) = (i x phi_a(j), ab). There is no explicit fusion table for c_1..c_8. Possibly 'eq 3.3' was confused with 'subsection 3.3'.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
