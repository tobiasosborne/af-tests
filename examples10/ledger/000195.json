{"type":"challenge_raised","timestamp":"2026-02-19T16:19:31.038667618Z","challenge_id":"ch-6298937310190b6e","node_id":"1.16","target":"statement","reason":"The node claims 'independent computation of Fib category, Deligne product, semidirect product with S_2, tube algebra, all representations, S and T matrices' via TensorCategories.jl, but the actual scripts only partially deliver this. WHAT TC.jl DOES COMPUTE INDEPENDENTLY: (1) fibonacci_category() -- Fib rank-2 category, F-symbols, quantum dimensions [verify_fib_foundations.jl uses TensorCategories]. (2) Fib boxtimes Fib Deligne product -- rank-4, F-symbols (225 nonzero) confirmed [compute_fsymbols.jl]. (3) (Fib boxtimes Fib) semidirect S_2 via gcrossed_product -- rank-8, 1800 nonzero F-symbols cross-checked against G-crossed formula with 0 discrepancies across 4096 blocks [fsymbols_fib2s2.txt]. (4) Monoidal functor axioms for both id and swap functors pass. WHAT TC.jl DOES NOT COMPUTE AND THE NODE OVERCLAIMS: (a) 'tube algebra' -- verify_tube_algebra.jl uses ONLY LinearAlgebra, no TensorCategories import. It implements eigenvalue substitution into paper eqs 2.10-2.12 by hand. TC.jl is not used. (b) 'all representations' -- verify_fib2s2.jl hardcodes the paper representation tables from the text and checks algebraic consistency. TC.jl does NOT enumerate the 22 representations via independent induction. (c) 'S and T matrices' -- verify_modular_22x22.jl uses ONLY LinearAlgebra, hardcoding the 22x22 matrices from paper lines 2893-2967 and checking S^2=I and (ST)^3=I algebraically. TC.jl does NOT produce these matrices independently. The file modular_data_fib2s2.txt does NOT exist on disk -- center(CxG) crashes with DomainError in induction_adjunction (0xN matrix inversion bug in TC.jl), so Step 9 of compute_fsymbols.jl is never reached. (d) pentagon_axiom() FAILS for CxG simples due to known TC.jl bug in associator() for non-simple SixJObjects. VERDICT: TC.jl independently verifies Fib, Fib boxtimes Fib, and (Fib boxtimes Fib) semidirect S_2 F-symbols only. The tube algebra, representation theory, and 22x22 S and T matrices are verified by hand computation from paper equations, not by TC.jl. The statement should be refined to accurately describe what TC.jl contributes versus what is hand-verified algebraically.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
