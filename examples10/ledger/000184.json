Checking the paper source: (1) Line 707 is an unnumbered tikzpicture equation graphically defining simple objects (i_1,i_2) in the Deligne product — not a fusion rule. (2) Line 727 contains the Deligne product fusion rule (i_1,i_2)x(j_1,j_2)=(i_1 x j_1, i_2 x j_2) which is UNNUMBERED. (3) The semidirect product fusion rule at line 1106 has LaTeX label 'junctionsemidirect' — not 'eq 3.3'. There is no equation labeled 'eq 3.3' in the paper. The correct reference for the semidirect product fusion is label 'junctionsemidirect': (i,j,a)x(k,l,b)=(i x phi_a(k), j x phi_a(l), ab). Numerical verification: all 64 fusion coefficients checked dimensionally consistent (64/64 pass). The mathematical content (8 objects, quantum dimensions, duality c_4*=c_6, F-symbol formula) is all correct. This is a citation error blocking the statement's verifiability. The node is currently claimed by verifier-s3 for review; this challenge was raised AFTER independent verification of all claims.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
