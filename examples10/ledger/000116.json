All claims confirmed: (1) 8 simple networks = horizontal lines for c_1..c_8, (2) 4 one-dim irreps from eigenvalue table, (3) 1 two-dim irrep with explicit 2x2 matrices, (4) 5 minimal central idempotents P_1^(1)-P_1^(5), (5) dimension check 4*1^2+1*2^2=8. Projectors numerically verified as idempotent, orthogonal, and complete. Minor note: eq 4.5 is approximate draft numbering; missing dependency on 1.5 (see challenge ch-ae50dd05788)."}
