(1) NETWORKS: The paper (TeX line 2158) explicitly states 'It admits SEVEN simple networks' — not 10. The 7 are: id_{c_3}, T_{c_3}, L_{c_3}^{c_3 c_3}, L_{c_3}^{c_5 c_7}, L_{c_3}^{c_7 c_5}, L_{c_3}^{c_7 c_7}, L_{c_3}^{c_8 c_8}. (2) IRREPS: TeX line 2315 explicitly states 'There are seven different one-dimensional solutions'. ALL 7 irreps are 1-dimensional. There are ZERO two-dimensional irreps. (3) DIMENSION CHECK: |L_3| = sum d_chi^2 = 7*1^2 = 7, matching 7 networks — fully consistent. The node's '3 one-dim + 2 two-dim' giving '3+8=11 not-equal 10' is vacuously wrong since the paper says 7+0. (4) PROJECTORS: P_{c_3}^{(1)}-P_{c_3}^{(5)} at label trivialPc3 (line 2317); P_{c_3}^{(6)}-P_{c_3}^{(7)} at lines 2336-2337. (5) CROSS-CHECK: The Drinfeld center table (lines 2856-2866) lists exactly P_{c_3}^{(1)} through P_{c_3}^{(7)}, all one-dimensional. Correct statement: 'Twisted c_3 Hilbert space: 7 networks, 7 one-dim irreps (7*1=7 consistent), projectors (label trivialPc3 and lines 2336-2337).'","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
