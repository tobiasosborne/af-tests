{"type":"node_validated","timestamp":"2026-02-07T21:20:13.457664946Z","node_id":"1.4.3","note":"The claim is mathematically correct. The product rule gives d/dt Tr[rho(t) log tau(t)] = Tr[delta_AB log tau(t)] + Tr[rho(t) D_log(tau(t))[dot_tau(t)]]. For the Frechet derivative term: (1) tau(t)=1_A x rho_B, dot_tau=1_A x delta_B correctly stated; (2) By tensor-product structure, D_log(1_A x rho_B)[1_A x delta_B] = 1_A x D_log(rho_B)[delta_B]; (3) Tr[rho_AB (1_A x D_log(rho_B)[delta_B])] = Tr_B[rho_B D_log(rho_B)[delta_B]] by partial trace; (4) Since both arguments are rho_B, Tr[rho_B D_log(rho_B)[delta_B]] = Tr[delta_B] by identity Tr[A D_log(A)[C]]=Tr[C]; (5) Tr[delta_B]=0. Minor challenge (ch-2631666bed303e85) raised: the reduction via tensor structure and partial trace should be made explicit."}
