Node 1.5.1: The first equality d/dt Tr(A(t)_+) = d/dt Tr[P_gamma(t) A(t)] uses the identity Tr(A_+) = Tr[PA] established in 1.5.1 (via A_+ = PAP and cyclicity of trace).\n\n2. Node 1.5.2: The differentiability of P(t) (needed to apply the product rule and obtain P'(t)) relies on the generic gamma hypothesis from 1.5.2 (no eigenvalue of A(t) equals zero), which ensures P(t) is a smooth function of t.\n\nThis is the THIRD time this dependency issue has been raised (previously ch-2da126bd81f41f22 and ch-d76c2ce1134731e9). Both previous challenges were marked 'resolved' but no dependencies were actually added to the node. The dependencies field still shows '(none)'.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
