By node 1.5.2, at generic gamma no eigenvalue of A(t) is zero, so P_gamma(t) is locally constant in t, giving dP_gamma/dt = 0. Therefore d/dt Tr(A(t)_+) = Tr[P_gamma(t) dot_A(t)]. Here dot_A(t) = delta_AB - gamma(1_A ⊗ delta_B).","new_statement":"Differentiating via the product rule: d/dt Tr(A(t)_+) = d/dt Tr[P_gamma(t) A(t)] = Tr[dP_gamma/dt · A(t)] + Tr[P_gamma(t) · dot_A(t)]. For the first term: since P_gamma(t) is a spectral projector of A(t), we have [P_gamma(t), A(t)] = 0. Differentiating P^2 = P gives P'P + PP' = P', so PP'P = 0. Since PA = AP (commutativity), Tr[P'A] = Tr[P'PA] = Tr[(PP'P)A] = 0 (using PP'P = 0 and cyclicity of trace). Therefore d/dt Tr(A(t)_+) = Tr[P_gamma(t) dot_A(t)]. Here dot_A(t) = delta_AB - gamma(1_A tensor delta_B) = delta_AB^{(gamma)}.","owner":"prover-fix-5d"}
