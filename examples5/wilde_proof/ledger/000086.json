{"type":"node_validated","timestamp":"2026-02-07T21:18:39.253360732Z","node_id":"1.2.2","note":"VERIFIED CORRECT. The identity log(1_A ⊗ rho_B) = 1_A ⊗ log(rho_B) is mathematically valid. Proof sketch: If rho_B = sum_j mu_j |f_j\u003e\u003cf_j| and {|e_i\u003e} is an ONB for H_A, then 1_A ⊗ rho_B = sum_{i,j} mu_j |e_i\u003e\u003ce_i| ⊗ |f_j\u003e\u003cf_j|, so log(1_A ⊗ rho_B) = sum_{i,j} log(mu_j) |e_i\u003e\u003ce_i| ⊗ |f_j\u003e\u003cf_j| = 1_A ⊗ log(rho_B). Positivity of rho_B (needed for log to be defined) is guaranteed by the full-rank assumption in node 1.1. A minor nomenclature note was filed: the result is more precisely \"functional calculus commutes with *-homomorphisms\" rather than \"spectral mapping theorem,\" but the mathematical content is unaffected."}
