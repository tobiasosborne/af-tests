The dominated convergence argument as written is therefore INVALID.\n\nHOWEVER, the conclusion (differentiation under the integral is justified) is CORRECT by a different argument: Under the full-rank assumption (node 1.1), rho(t) \u003e 0 for all t in [0,1]. For sufficiently small gamma, rho(t) - gamma*tau(t) \u003e 0, so E_gamma(rho(t)||tau(t)) = Tr[rho(t) - gamma*tau(t)] = 1 - gamma*d_A, which is t-independent. Hence d/dt E_gamma = 0 for gamma below some threshold gamma_0(t) \u003e 0. By compactness of [0,1] and continuity, gamma_0 can be chosen uniformly. Therefore the integrand vanishes near gamma = 0, the problematic 1/gamma singularity is removed, and dominated convergence applies on the remaining compact domain [gamma_0, M(t)] where [gamma(1+d_A*gamma)]^{-1} is bounded.\n\nThe fix: replace the dominating function argument with the observation that d/dt E_gamma = 0 for gamma \u003c gamma_0 (uniform in t), then use the stated bound only on [gamma_0, infinity) where 1/gamma is bounded.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
