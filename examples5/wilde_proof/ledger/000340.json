The off-block-diagonal argument from 1.5.3.1 transfers cleanly: Q is a spectral projector of B so [Q,B]=0; differentiating Q^2=Q gives Q' off-block-diagonal; hence Tr[Q'B]=0 and d/dt Tr(B_+) = Tr[Q dot_B]. The computation dot_B = 1_A x delta_B - beta delta_AB is verified: dot_tau = 1_A x delta_B (from linearity of partial trace) and dot_rho = delta_AB. Minor dependency issue raised as ch-2ab3f7853ac3f3e8: node should declare dependencies on 1.8.1 and 1.8.2."}
