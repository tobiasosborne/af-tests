It should ideally be cited as an external. Additionally, Tr is used ambiguously: on the LHS it denotes the full trace over H_A tensor H_B, while on the RHS it denotes the trace over H_B alone. This is standard but worth noting. Finally, log rho_B is well-defined under the convention 0 log 0 = 0 stated in the entropy definition, which is implicitly invoked here.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
