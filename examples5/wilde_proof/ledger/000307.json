For the first term: since P = P_gamma(t) is a spectral projector of A = A(t), we have [P, A] = 0 (both block-diagonal in the P-decomposition). Differentiating P^2 = P gives P'P + PP' = P', hence PP'P = 0 and (I-P)P'(I-P) = 0, so P' = PP'(I-P) + (I-P)P'P is off-block-diagonal. Since A is block-diagonal (commutes with P), the product P'A is off-block-diagonal. Off-block-diagonal operators have zero trace: Tr[P'A] = Tr[PP'(I-P)A] + Tr[(I-P)P'PA] = Tr[PP'A(I-P)] + Tr[(I-P)P'AP] = Tr[(I-P)PP'A] + Tr[P(I-P)P'A] = 0 + 0 = 0 (using P(I-P) = 0 and cyclicity). Therefore d/dt Tr(A(t)_+) = Tr[P_gamma(t) dot_A(t)]. Here dot_A(t) = delta_AB - gamma(1_A tensor delta_B) = delta_AB^{(gamma)}.","inference":"assumption","dependencies":["1.5.1","1.5.2"],"workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"c8ee41a03a2e978675548fad526dcd792eb284aed3d5e7a12807f79ebb870898","created":"2026-02-07T21:39:37.789798843Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
