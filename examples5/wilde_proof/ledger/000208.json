The spectral projector P(t) = 1{A(t)\u003e0} is NOT locally constant when eigenvalues are nonzero. As t varies, even when no eigenvalue crosses zero, the eigenvectors rotate, causing P(t) to change smoothly. Concretely: take A(t) = [[1+t, t],[t, -(1+t)]]. Eigenvalues are +/- sqrt((1+t)^2+t^2), always nonzero. At t=0, P=diag(1,0). By first-order perturbation theory with B=dA/dt=[[1,1],[1,-1]], we get P'(0) = [[0,1/2],[1/2,0]] != 0.\n\nThe CONCLUSION d/dt Tr(A_+) = Tr[P dot_A] is correct, but for a different reason. The correct justification is either:\n\n(A) Algebraic: Since [P(t), A(t)] = 0 (spectral projector commutes with its operator), and PP'P = 0 (from differentiating P^2=P), the matrix P'(t) is off-diagonal in the eigenbasis of A(t) while A(t) is diagonal, so Tr[P'(t) A(t)] = 0.\n\n(B) Hellmann-Feynman: When no eigenvalue is zero, Tr(A_+) = sum_{i: lambda_i\u003e0} lambda_i(t), which is smooth, and d/dt lambda_i = \u003ce_i| A'(t) |e_i\u003e by the Hellmann-Feynman theorem. So d/dt Tr(A_+) = sum_{i: lambda_i\u003e0} \u003ce_i|A'|e_i\u003e = Tr[P A'].\n\nThe statement should replace 'P_gamma(t) is locally constant in t, giving dP_gamma/dt = 0' with a valid justification for Tr[P'(t) A(t)] = 0.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
