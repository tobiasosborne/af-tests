Individual eigenprojections are NOT smooth at eigenvalue crossings (where two positive eigenvalues coincide), by standard Rellich-Kato theory. What IS true, and what the argument actually needs, is that the total spectral projection P_gamma(t) = 1{A(t)\u003e0} onto the positive eigenspace is smooth (analytic) in t when zero is not in the spectrum of A(t). This follows because zero lies in the resolvent set at generic gamma, so the contour integral representation of P_gamma(t) yields analyticity. The conclusion (differentiability of Tr(A(t)_+)) is correct but the intermediate claim about individual eigenprojections should be replaced by a claim about the aggregate spectral projection P_gamma(t).","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
