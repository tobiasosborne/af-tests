By the Fréchet derivative identity Tr[A D_log(B)[C]] = Tr[B^{-1} A C] in the full-rank case, the second part gives Tr[delta_AB] = 0 (since delta_AB is traceless). So d/dt Tr[rho(t) log rho(t)] = Tr[delta_AB log rho(t)].","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"f5dd947cd017f0a5e4f542a84f103a97474a8f375e28f8701eb3dc609f9d685d","created":"2026-02-07T21:13:42.062210424Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
