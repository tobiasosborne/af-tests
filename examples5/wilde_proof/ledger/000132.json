The conclusion that Tr(A(t)_+) is differentiable at generic gamma is CORRECT. The correct justification: (1) At generic gamma, zero is in the resolvent set of A(t), so the spectral projection P_+(t) onto the positive eigenspace is analytic in t by the contour integral representation. (2) A(t) is affine hence smooth. (3) Tr(A(t)_+) = Tr(P_+(t)A(t)) is smooth. The minor challenge notes that eigenprojections should refer to the aggregate spectral projection, not individual eigenprojections which can fail smoothness at eigenvalue crossings."}
