{"type":"node_validated","timestamp":"2026-02-07T21:18:52.90043236Z","node_id":"1.2.1","note":"VERIFIED CORRECT. The claim is a direct, correct application of the Umegaki relative entropy definition.\n\nVERIFICATION DETAILS:\n\n1. DEFINITION CHECK: The entropy definition in scope states D(rho||sigma) := Tr[rho(log rho - log sigma)] when supp(rho) ⊆ supp(sigma). Substituting rho = rho_AB, sigma = 1_A ⊗ rho_B and distributing the trace over the difference gives exactly Tr[rho_AB log rho_AB] - Tr[rho_AB log(1_A ⊗ rho_B)]. This uses only the linearity of trace, which is elementary.\n\n2. SUPPORT CONDITION: The definition requires supp(rho_AB) ⊆ supp(1_A ⊗ rho_B). Under the full-rank assumption (node 1.1), rho_AB \u003e 0, and rho_B = Tr_A[rho_AB] \u003e 0 (partial trace preserves strict positivity). Therefore 1_A ⊗ rho_B \u003e 0, so supp(1_A ⊗ rho_B) = H_AB, and the support condition is trivially satisfied. The claim does not explicitly cite node 1.1, but the support condition is automatically satisfied in the full-rank context established by the parent node 1.2.\n\n3. LINEARITY OF TRACE: The step Tr[rho(log rho - log sigma)] = Tr[rho log rho] - Tr[rho log sigma] uses linearity of trace, which is elementary.\n\n4. WELL-DEFINEDNESS OF LOGARITHMS: Both rho_AB \u003e 0 and 1_A ⊗ rho_B \u003e 0 under the full-rank assumption, so the matrix logarithms are well-defined.\n\nMINOR NOTES (non-blocking):\n- The node could ideally declare a dependency on node 1.1 (full-rank assumption) to make the support condition explicit, but this is inherited from the parent context.\n\nVERDICT: ACCEPT."}
