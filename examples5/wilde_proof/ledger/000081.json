The partial trace identity Tr[rho_AB (1_A tensor X_B)] = Tr_B[rho_B X_B] with X_B = log rho_B yields the first equality. The second equality Tr[rho_B log rho_B] = -S(rho_B) follows directly from the definition S(rho) = -Tr[rho log rho]. A minor scope note was raised regarding the partial trace property not being declared as an external reference."}
