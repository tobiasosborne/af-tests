{"type":"node_amended","timestamp":"2026-02-07T21:30:30.917404191Z","node_id":"1.7.5","previous_statement":"Fubini-Tonelli applies since the integrand is bounded: |Tr[P_gamma(t) delta_AB^{(gamma)}]| ≤ ||delta_AB^{(gamma)}||_1 ≤ ||delta_AB||_1 + gamma d_A ||delta_B||_1 which is finite, and [gamma(1+d_A gamma)]^{-1} is integrable on (0,d_A]. The domain [0,1] × [0,d_A] is compact.","new_statement":"Fubini-Tonelli applies to justify the iterated integral. Under the full-rank assumption (node 1.1), rho(t) \u003e 0 for all t in [0,1]. By compactness of [0,1] and continuity of the minimum eigenvalue of rho(t), there exists c \u003e 0 (uniform in t) such that for all gamma in (0,c) and all t in [0,1], rho(t) - gamma tau(t) \u003e 0, hence P_gamma(t) = I. Then Tr[P_gamma(t) delta_AB^{(gamma)}] = Tr[delta_AB] - gamma Tr[1_A tensor delta_B] = 0 - gamma d_A Tr[delta_B] = 0, since Tr[delta_AB] = 0 (both states have unit trace) and Tr[delta_B] = 0 (partial traces preserve trace). Therefore the integrand vanishes on [0,1] x (0,c). On the remaining domain [0,1] x [c, d_A], the factor [gamma(1+d_A gamma)]^{-1} is bounded by [c(1+d_A c)]^{-1}, and the numerator is bounded by ||delta_AB||_1 + d_A^2 ||delta_B||_1. Hence the integrand is bounded on this compact domain, and Fubini-Tonelli applies.","owner":"prover-fix-7b"}
