Steps 1.7.1-1.7.3 correctly cite the three ingredients (FTC, CE-RE, DER-HS), and 1.7.4 correctly assembles them into the iterated integral with the correct sign (negative, from H = -D). The formula in node 1.7 matches the formula in 1.7.4 and 1.7.6 exactly. The ONLY issue is the embedded Fubini justification text, which is covered by challenge ch-de8e84eddfdf42a4. Once the Fubini justification in 1.7.5 and the parent statement are corrected to use the full-rank vanishing argument (integrand = 0 near gamma = 0), node 1.7 should be acceptable.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
