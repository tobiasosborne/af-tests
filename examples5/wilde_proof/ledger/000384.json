The node text acknowledges this with '(1.6, via 1.6.6)', but the formal dependency should explicitly include 1.6.6. Node 1.6 still states the wrong single-integral formula with kernel [gamma(1+d_A*gamma)]^{-1}. Dependencies should be amended to {1.3, 1.2, 1.6.6}.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
