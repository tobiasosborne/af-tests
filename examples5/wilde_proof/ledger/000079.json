However, the justification \"spectral mapping theorem for tensor products\" is not the most precise name for the underlying result. The spectral mapping theorem states sigma(f(A)) = f(sigma(A)), which is about spectra. The result used here is that functional calculus commutes with unital *-homomorphisms: since phi(X) = 1_A ⊗ X is a unital *-homomorphism, phi(f(B)) = f(phi(B)) for any continuous function f on the spectrum of B. A more precise name would be \"functional calculus for tensor products\" or \"preservation of functional calculus under *-homomorphisms.\" This is a nomenclature issue only; the mathematical content is sound.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
