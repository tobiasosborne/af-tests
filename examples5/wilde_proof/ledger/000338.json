(2) Node 1.8.2: provides smoothness of Q_beta(t) in t at generic beta, which is needed to apply the product rule d/dt Tr[QB] = Tr[Q'B] + Tr[Q dot_B]. Without smoothness of Q, the product rule step is unjustified. The forward analogue 1.5.3 had three dependency challenges for the same issue before its sub-node 1.5.3.1 properly declared dependencies on 1.5.1 and 1.5.2. Node 1.8.3 should declare dependencies on 1.8.1 and 1.8.2. Additionally, the reference should more precisely cite 1.5.3.1, which contains the validated correct off-block-diagonal proof (1.5.3 own statement contains algebraic errors in the trace chain, as documented in challenge ch-d89bf26d8472daac).","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
