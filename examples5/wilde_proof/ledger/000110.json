(2) A(t) Hermitian since rho(t), tau(t) Hermitian and gamma real. (3) Spectral theorem applies. (4) Positive part A_+ correctly defined by zeroing negative eigenvalues. (5) PAP = A_+ identity correct: P is spectral projector of A so P commutes with A, hence PAP = P^2*A = PA = A_+. Zero eigenvalues correctly excluded from P (strict inequality) since they contribute zero to A_+."}
