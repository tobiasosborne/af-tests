Only after these reductions is it the case that A = B = rho_B in the Fréchet derivative identity Tr[A D_log(A)[C]] = Tr[C], which justifies writing Tr[rho_B delta_B rho_B^{-1}]. Without these steps the claim implicitly uses Tr[X D_log(Y)[Z]] = Tr[Y^{-1} X Z] for X ≠ Y, which is false in general. The final answer is correct but the exposition should make the reduction explicit.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
