Specifically: (1) it uses E_beta = Tr(B_+) from 1.8.1, (2) it relies on the smoothness hypothesis from 1.8.2, and (3) it directly invokes the differentiation formula d/dt Tr(B_+) = Tr[Q dot_B] from 1.8.3 with the expression dot_B = 1_A x delta_B - beta delta_AB also from 1.8.3. All three nodes (1.8.1, 1.8.2, 1.8.3) should be declared as dependencies. The logical content itself is correct: the conclusion follows by direct substitution from these three sub-results.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
