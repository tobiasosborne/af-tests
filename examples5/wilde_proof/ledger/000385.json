{"type":"node_validated","timestamp":"2026-02-10T20:08:56.882829872Z","node_id":"1.7.7","note":"Mathematical content verified correct. Chain: FTC (1.3) + CE-RE (1.2) + corrected DER-HS (1.6.6) correctly yields MAIN'. Sign: H=-D =\u003e d/dt H = -d/dt D, outer minus correct. Integration limits correct from FR-bip. Fubini justified by bounded integrands on bounded domains. Minor dependency issue: should formally depend on 1.6.6 not 1.6 (see ch-7faa27bb28d011c0)."}
