The corrected two-integral formula that node 1.9 actually restates comes from node 1.7.7 (MAIN-corrected, validated). The formal dependency should be on 1.7.7 (or at minimum 1.7.7 should be added as an explicit dependency), not merely 1.7. This mirrors the analogous dependency issue already raised in open challenge ch-7faa27bb28d011c0 on node 1.7.7 itself. The mathematical content of node 1.9 is correct and matches 1.7.7 exactly; only the dependency metadata needs correction.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
