The claim asserts 'Tr[A D_log(B)[C]] = Tr[B^{-1} A C] in the full-rank case' as a general identity. This is FALSE for arbitrary A. Working in the eigenbasis of B with eigenvalues lambda_i, the correct expression involves the matrix mean f(lambda_i, lambda_j) = (log lambda_i - log lambda_j)/(lambda_i - lambda_j) for i\\!=j and 1/lambda_i for i=j — this equals B^{-1} only on diagonal. However, the SPECIAL CASE A=B used in the proof IS correct: Tr[B D_log(B)[C]] = integral_0^inf sum_i lambda_i C_{ii}/(lambda_i+s)^2 ds = sum_i C_{ii} = Tr[C]. So the conclusion Tr[rho(t) D_log(rho(t))[delta_AB]] = Tr[delta_AB] = 0 is valid. The misstated general identity should be corrected to the specific identity Tr[B D_log(B)[C]] = Tr[C] for B \u003e 0.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
