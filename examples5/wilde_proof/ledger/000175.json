The claim asserts that [gamma(1+d_A*gamma)]^{-1} is integrable on (0,d_A], but this is FALSE: integral_0^{d_A} 1/[gamma(1+d_A*gamma)] d gamma diverges because the 1/gamma term gives integral_0^epsilon 1/gamma d gamma = +infinity. The bound |Tr[P_gamma(t) delta_AB^{(gamma)}]| \u003c= ||delta_AB^{(gamma)}||_1 \u003c= ||delta_AB||_1 + gamma*d_A*||delta_B||_1 is valid but too crude: near gamma=0 it gives a nonzero constant ||delta_AB||_1, and ||delta_AB||_1/gamma is not integrable. The CORRECT argument uses the full-rank assumption: since rho(t) \u003e 0 for all t in [0,1], there exists c \u003e 0 (uniform in t by compactness) such that P_gamma(t) = I for all gamma \u003c c. When P_gamma = I, Tr[I * delta_AB^{(gamma)}] = Tr[delta_AB] - gamma*Tr[1_A tensor delta_B] = 0 - gamma*d_A*0 = 0, since both rho and sigma are trace-1 so Tr[delta_AB]=0 and Tr[delta_B]=0. The integrand vanishes on [0,1] x (0,c), so Fubini applies on the remaining compact domain [0,1] x [c, d_A] where the integrand is bounded. The conclusion (Fubini applies) is correct, but the justification as stated contains a fundamental mathematical error.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
