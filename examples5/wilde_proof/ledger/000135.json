{"type":"node_validated","timestamp":"2026-02-07T21:20:31.098482888Z","node_id":"1.4.2","note":"VERIFIED CORRECT. The product rule is properly applied: d/dt Tr[rho(t) log rho(t)] = Tr[delta_AB log rho(t)] + Tr[rho(t) D_log(rho(t))[delta_AB]]. The identity Tr[B D_log(B)[C]] = Tr[C] for B \u003e 0 was verified by explicit integral computation in the eigenbasis: each diagonal term contributes integral_0^inf lambda_i/(lambda_i+s)^2 ds = 1, giving Tr[C]. With C = delta_AB traceless, the second term vanishes. Two minor challenges filed: (1) the general form Tr[A D_log(B)[C]] = Tr[B^{-1}AC] is FALSE as stated — only the A=B specialization is used and valid; (2) missing dependency on node 1.1 (full-rank) and the interpolating_path definition."}
