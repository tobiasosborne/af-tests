In fact, rho_AB and sigma_AB ARE density matrices on H_A tensor H_B (not partial traces of something else). The conclusion Tr[delta_AB] = 0 is correct regardless, since Tr[rho_AB] = Tr[sigma_AB] = 1. Also, the derivation of Tr[B D_log(B)[C]] = Tr[C] implicitly uses that B commutes with (B+sI)^{-1} (trivially true since B+sI is a polynomial in B) to reduce the integrand to B(B+sI)^{-2}. These are standard facts that do not affect validity.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
