This repeats the same flawed justification that child node 1.7.5 has been critically challenged on (ch-40e6ca8a4a7). The integrand Tr[P_gamma(t) delta_AB^{(gamma)}] / [gamma(1+d_A gamma)] is NOT bounded on (0,d_A]: the factor 1/[gamma(1+d_A gamma)] diverges as gamma -\u003e 0+. The phrase 'bounded integrand' is mathematically incorrect. The correct Fubini justification requires the full-rank argument: for gamma sufficiently small (uniformly in t by compactness), P_gamma(t) = I and Tr[I * delta_AB^{(gamma)}] = Tr[delta_AB] - gamma*Tr[1_A tensor delta_B] = 0 (both traces vanish since rho, sigma are unit-trace). The integrand therefore vanishes near gamma = 0, removing the singularity, and Fubini applies on the effective compact domain. The conclusion of 1.7 is correct, but the stated justification needs correction.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
