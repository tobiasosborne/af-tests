(2) Under full-rank assumption (node 1.1 -\u003e 1.3.1), both S(rho(t)_AB) and S(rho(t)_B) are C^infinity in t since von Neumann entropy is analytic on positive definite matrices, so C^1 trivially holds. (3) Difference of C^1 functions is C^1. (4) FTC applies to C^1 functions on [0,1] (C^1 implies absolute continuity). (5) The equation f(1)-f(0)=int_0^1 f'(t)dt is the standard FTC statement applied to f(t)=H(A|B)_{rho(t)}. Minor note: no explicit dependency on 1.3.1 declared, but this is structural, not mathematical."}
