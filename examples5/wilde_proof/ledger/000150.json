For a fixed gamma \u003e M(t_0) at some particular t_0, it is NOT true that E_gamma = 0 for ALL t, since M(t) varies and gamma might be less than M(t_1) at some other t_1. What is true is: at each fixed t, E_gamma(rho(t)||tau(t)) = 0 for gamma \u003e M(t); and since M is continuous (by full-rank assumption ensuring continuity of eigenvalues), E_gamma vanishes in a neighborhood of t, so the t-derivative is also 0. The conclusion is correct but the phrasing 'identically in t' could mislead. A more precise statement: 'For each fixed t, the integrand vanishes for gamma \u003e M(t), so the gamma-integral truncates to (0, M(t)).' The bound M(t) \u003c= d_A is standard (follows from D_max(rho||1_A tensor rho_B) \u003c= log d_A).","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
