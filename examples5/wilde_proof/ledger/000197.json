{"type":"node_validated","timestamp":"2026-02-07T21:24:11.492109381Z","node_id":"1.6","note":"The logical chain from children to parent is VALID: (1.6.1) writes the Frenkel formula, (1.6.2) differentiates under the integral, (1.6.3) substitutes the d/dt E_gamma formula from node 1.5, (1.6.4) truncates the upper integration limit to M(t), and (1.6.5) combines these to obtain the stated formula. This chain is complete and correct. CAVEAT: Node 1.6.2 remains PENDING with an open challenge identifying that the stated dominating function is not integrable near gamma=0. However, the CONCLUSION of 1.6.2 is mathematically correct: under the full-rank assumption, d/dt E_gamma = 0 for sufficiently small gamma, so the singularity is removable. Node 1.6 should be considered conditionally validated pending resolution of 1.6.2."}
