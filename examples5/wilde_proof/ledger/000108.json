The claim has two parts: (1) rho(t) \u003e 0 and rho(t)_B \u003e 0 for all t in [0,1] -- correct because positive definite matrices form a convex set and partial trace preserves strict positivity. (2) S(rho(t)) and S(rho(t)_B) are C^inf in t -- the conclusion is correct. The correct justification: the map A -\u003e -Tr[A log A] is analytic on the open cone of positive definite matrices; composing with the affine map t -\u003e rho(t) gives a C^inf function by the chain rule. The stated reasoning about eigenvalues being smooth is technically imprecise (see minor challenge) but does not affect the conclusion."}
