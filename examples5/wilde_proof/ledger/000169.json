By the identity Tr[B D_log(B)[C]] = Tr[C] for B \u003e 0 (which follows from the integral representation D_log(B)[C] = integral_0^infty (B+sI)^{-1} C (B+sI)^{-1} ds and cyclicity of trace), the second part with B = rho(t) \u003e 0 (by node 1.1) and C = delta_AB gives Tr[delta_AB] = 0 (since delta_AB = sigma_AB - rho_AB is traceless, both being partial traces of density matrices). So d/dt Tr[rho(t) log rho(t)] = Tr[delta_AB log rho(t)].","inference":"assumption","dependencies":["1.1"],"workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"bc9df96d94f7a7bf3631435c82ea204260391e69179230739cf19fba22abf032","created":"2026-02-07T21:21:57.265726603Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
