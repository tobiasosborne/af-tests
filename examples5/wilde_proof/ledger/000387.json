Projector definitions (P_beta forward, Q_beta reverse) are consistent with nodes 1.5 and 1.8. Numerical claim of 37 test cases matches verify_hockey_stick.jl script (12 hardcoded + 25 random). Minor dependency challenge ch-56e2e1fee68f7814 raised: dep should reference 1.7.7 not 1.7, but this is metadata-only and does not affect mathematical correctness."}
