Individual eigenvalues of a smoothly-parameterized Hermitian matrix family are continuous but NOT necessarily smooth (C^inf) -- they can fail to be differentiable at eigenvalue crossings (Kato, Rellich). However, the CONCLUSION is correct: S(rho(t)) = -Tr[rho(t) log rho(t)] is smooth because the map A -\u003e -Tr[A log A] is smooth (analytic) on the open cone of strictly positive definite matrices, and t -\u003e rho(t) is affine with rho(t) \u003e 0 for all t. The smoothness follows from the chain rule, not from smoothness of individual eigenvalues. This is a cosmetic issue that does not affect the validity of the conclusion.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
