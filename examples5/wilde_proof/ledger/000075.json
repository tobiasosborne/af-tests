Additionally, it implicitly uses the definition of von Neumann entropy to identify Tr[rho_AB log rho_AB] = -S(rho_AB), which is not explicitly stated in any sibling -- though this follows directly from the definition and is a minor gap. The algebra itself is correct.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
