The argument implicitly relies on the fact (established in sibling node 1.6.4) that d/dt E_gamma = 0 for gamma \u003e M(t) \u003c= d_A, so the effective integration domain is [gamma_0, d_A] which is compact. On this compact interval, boundedness suffices for DCT. The conclusion is correct but the statement should either (a) explicitly restrict to [gamma_0, d_A] or (b) cite node 1.6.4 for the vanishing tail. This is a presentation gap, not a logical error.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
