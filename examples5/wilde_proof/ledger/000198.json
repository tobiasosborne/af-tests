The logical chain 1.5.1 -\u003e 1.5.2 -\u003e 1.5.3 -\u003e 1.5.4 correctly proves the parent claim. (1) 1.5.1 establishes E_gamma = Tr(PA) via spectral decomposition and cyclicity of trace. (2) 1.5.2 establishes differentiability at generic gamma. (3) 1.5.3 (amended, pending re-verification) correctly applies product rule with dP/dt=0 and computes dA/dt = delta_AB - gamma(1_A x delta_B). (4) 1.5.4 assembles the conclusion. NOTE: Node 1.5.3 is still pending formal re-verification but its amended content is mathematically correct."}
