For the forward term, [1/d_A, M_fwd(t)] is in [1/d_A, d_A] with bounded kernel 1/beta \u003c= d_A and bounded numerator. For the reverse term, [d_A, M_rev(t)] requires sup_t M_rev(t) \u003c infty by compactness of [0,1] and continuity under full rank. Both are correct but could be more explicit. This is cosmetic, not a mathematical gap.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
