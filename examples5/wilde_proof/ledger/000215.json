The exchange of d/dt and ∫ d gamma is justified by dominated convergence: |d/dt E_gamma| ≤ ||delta_AB||_1 + gamma ||1_A ⊗ delta_B||_1 which is integrable against [gamma(1+d_A gamma)]^{-1} on (0,d_A].","new_statement":"Differentiate under the integral sign: d/dt D(rho(t)||tau(t)) = integral_0^infinity [d/dt E_gamma(rho(t)||tau(t))] / [gamma(1 + d_A gamma)] d gamma. The exchange of d/dt and integral is justified as follows: Under the full-rank assumption (node 1.1), rho(t) \u003e 0 for all t in [0,1]. By compactness of [0,1] and continuity of the minimum eigenvalue lambda_min(rho(t)), there exists gamma_0 \u003e 0 (uniform in t) such that rho(t) - gamma tau(t) \u003e 0 for all gamma \u003c gamma_0 and all t. For such gamma, E_gamma(rho(t)||tau(t)) = Tr[rho(t) - gamma tau(t)] = 1 - gamma d_A, which is t-independent, so d/dt E_gamma = 0. Therefore the integrand vanishes on (0, gamma_0). On [gamma_0, infinity), the bound |d/dt E_gamma| \u003c= ||delta_AB||_1 + gamma ||1_A tensor delta_B||_1 is finite, and [gamma(1 + d_A gamma)]^{-1} \u003c= [gamma_0(1+d_A gamma_0)]^{-1} is bounded. Dominated convergence applies on [gamma_0, infinity).","owner":"prover-fix-6b"}
