The previous dependency challenge (ch-2da126bd81f41f22) was marked resolved but no dependencies were actually added. Node 1.5.3 logically depends on:\n- Node 1.5.1: provides Tr(A(t)_+) = Tr[P(t) A(t)] (used in the first equality)\n- Node 1.5.2: provides the generic gamma hypothesis (explicitly cited in the statement)\nThese should be declared as formal dependencies.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
