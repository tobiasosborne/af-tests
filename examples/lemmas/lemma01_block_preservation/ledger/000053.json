Even if cycle notation were defined, the proof should show explicitly HOW the cycle is read to arrive at these values. For example: 'In cycle (5 6 2 3), reading left to right, 5 maps to 6, 6 maps to 2, 2 maps to 3, 3 maps to 5. Therefore h_3(5)=6.' The current proof states the values as if self-evident, but the computation is non-trivial for a rigorous verification.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
