However, this fact is not in scope as an explicit assumption or definition. The cycle notation (1 6 4 3) etc. suggests these are permutations, but the formal claim that they are bijections on {1,2,3,4,5,6} should be an explicit assumption in scope. Furthermore, the word 'permutation' here is overloaded - it could mean permutation of elements or permutation of blocks - creating semantic ambiguity.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
