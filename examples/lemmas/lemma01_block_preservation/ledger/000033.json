Specifically, node 1 claims the partition preservation property AND gives specific mappings like 'h_1({1,4}) = {3,6}'. The conclusion should explicitly verify that the specific mappings claimed in node 1 match those established in nodes 1.2-1.4. While they appear to match by inspection, this correspondence is not formally verified or stated.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
