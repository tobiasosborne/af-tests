The proof shows: {1,4} -\u003e {2,5}, {2,5} -\u003e {1,4}, {3,6} -\u003e {3,6}. But concluding 'h_2 maps B_0 to itself' requires: (1) Each image is in B_0 (verified by inspection), (2) The mapping is surjective (which is shown, but not stated explicitly), (3) The mapping is a bijection on B_0 (which follows from h_2 being a bijection on the base set, but this lemma is not cited). The phrase 'permutes B_0' means the induced map on blocks is a bijection, which requires this additional step.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
