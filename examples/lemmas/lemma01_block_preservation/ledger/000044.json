An assumption should be something taken as given without proof. This node performs explicit calculations (computing images of elements under the cycle, computing images of sets). The correct inference type should be 'direct_computation' or 'by_calculation', not 'assumption'. This is a fundamental misclassification of the node type.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
