While this is standard, a maximally rigorous proof would either: (1) State explicitly that set notation denotes unordered collections where {a,b} = {b,a}, or (2) Reference a definition of set equality (extensionality). This is a minor issue since set equality is foundational, but in a formal verification context it should be acknowledged.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
