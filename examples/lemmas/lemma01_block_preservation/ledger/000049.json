When we write h_2(1) = 2, we are using h_2 as a function from integers to integers (or from the set {1,...,6} to itself). When we write h_2({1,4}) = {2,5}, we are using h_2 as a function from sets to sets (the induced action on power sets). These are formally different functions: h_2: X -\u003e X versus h_2^*: P(X) -\u003e P(X). The proof uses the same notation for both, which is a type-level ambiguity. A rigorous proof would distinguish these, for example writing sigma^*(S) := {sigma(x) : x in S} or using different notation.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
