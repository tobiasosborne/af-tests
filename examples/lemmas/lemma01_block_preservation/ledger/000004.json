The proof splits into three parts: (1) showing h_1 permutes B_0, (2) showing h_2 permutes B_0, and (3) showing h_3 permutes B_0. Each part requires computing the image of each block under the respective cycle.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"805aed8be58043e7e0f41bfe9507ba103b8178d6b50a750d56897dcfe8ea6713","created":"2026-01-17T14:47:56.13113999Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
