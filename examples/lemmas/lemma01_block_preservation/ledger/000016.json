The node claims that B_0 is 'preserved setwise' by each h_i, but nowhere in this proof tree is there a rigorous definition of what 'preserved setwise' means for a partition. The standard definition would be: a partition P is preserved setwise by a permutation g if for every block B in P, the image g(B) is also a block in P (i.e., g(B) ∈ P). This definition is assumed but never stated. Without an explicit definition, the conclusion is semantically incomplete.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
