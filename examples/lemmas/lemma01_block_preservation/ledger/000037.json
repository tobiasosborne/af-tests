The cycle notation (1 6 4 3) has different meanings depending on whether the ambient symmetric group is S_6, S_7, or some other S_n. While context strongly suggests S_6, rigorous mathematics requires explicit specification of the domain. Additionally, it should be stated that B_0 is a partition of {1,2,3,4,5,6} (i.e., the blocks are disjoint and their union is the full set).","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
