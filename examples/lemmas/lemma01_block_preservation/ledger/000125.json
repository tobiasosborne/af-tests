These are entirely different permutations. For example, according to the definition h_1(1) = 4, but node 1.2 computes h_1(1) = 6 (consistent with the 4-cycle (1 6 4 3)). This is a fundamental inconsistency that invalidates the entire proof. The definition must be corrected to match the permutations actually used in the proof.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
