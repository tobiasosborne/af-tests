What does it mean for a permutation to 'permute' a partition? Formally, this should mean that h_3 induces a bijection on B_0 as a set of blocks, i.e., for each block B in B_0, h_3(B) is also a block in B_0. The statement conflates the induced action on the partition with the action on elements. The phrase 'maps B_0 to itself' in the conclusion is similarly imprecise - does this mean setwise preservation (h_3(B_0) = B_0 as a set of sets) or pointwise preservation (each block maps to itself)?","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
