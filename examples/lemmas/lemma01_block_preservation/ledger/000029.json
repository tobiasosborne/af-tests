Is h_2 a permutation of {1,2,3,4,5,6}? Or of some other set? The cycle (1 2 4 5) only mentions elements 1,2,4,5 but the proof applies h_2 to elements 3 and 6, claiming h_2(3) = 3 and h_2(6) = 6. This requires knowing that h_2 is defined on a set containing {1,2,3,4,5,6}. The domain must be explicitly stated.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
