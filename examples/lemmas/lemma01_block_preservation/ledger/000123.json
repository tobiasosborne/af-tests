The node makes substantive computational claims (h_3(2)=3, h_3(5)=6, etc.) that are derived from definitions, not assumed as hypotheses. The inference type should be 'computation' or 'direct_verification'. Running 'af get 1.4' confirms 'Inference: assumption' is still the recorded inference type. The resolution did not actually change the inference type in the node metadata.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
