The proof implicitly assumes h_3 is a permutation of the set {1,2,3,4,5,6}, but this is never stated. Different domains would yield different mathematical objects. Is h_3 a bijection on {1,...,6}? On the natural numbers? On a specific underlying set X from which B_0 is a partition? The domain must be explicitly stated for the function to be well-defined.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
