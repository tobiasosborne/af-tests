Logically, this node must depend on: (1) A definition of cycle notation; (2) A definition of permutation action on sets; (3) A definition of B_0 and its elements; (4) A specification of the domain of h_3. Without explicit dependencies, the proof structure is malformed and the node floats without proper logical grounding.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
