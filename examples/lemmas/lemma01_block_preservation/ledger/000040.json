This node makes substantive computational claims (h_3(2)=3, h_3(5)=6, etc.) that require derivation from definitions, not mere assumption. An 'assumption' inference type suggests this is a hypothesis taken as given, but the node purports to PROVE that h_3 permutes B_0 through explicit computation. The proper inference type should be 'computation' or 'direct_verification' or similar, with dependencies on the definitions of cycle notation and set action.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
