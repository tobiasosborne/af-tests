An assumption is a hypothesis taken without proof; a conclusion requires an explicit inference rule (e.g., conjunction introduction, or a deduction step). The inference type 'assumption' is semantically incorrect for a node that claims to follow from prior results.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
