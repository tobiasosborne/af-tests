A fully rigorous proof would show: Under cycle (1 6 4 3), element 1 maps to the element immediately following it in the cycle, which is 6. Element 6 maps to 4. Element 4 maps to 3. Element 3 maps to 1 (wrapping). Each step should reference the cycle definition being used.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
