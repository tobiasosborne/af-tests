What exactly does (1 2 4 5) mean? Is this the permutation that maps 1-\u003e2-\u003e4-\u003e5-\u003e1? Or is it a different convention (some authors use right-to-left)? The proof requires an explicit definition: cycle_notation ::= a list (a_1 a_2 ... a_k) representing the bijection sigma on {1,...,n} where sigma(a_i) = a_{i+1 mod k} and sigma(x) = x for all x not in {a_1,...,a_k}. Without this definition, the meaning of h_2(1) = 2 cannot be verified.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
