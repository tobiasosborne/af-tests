The proof implicitly assumes h_1 acts on {1,2,3,4,5,6}, but this is never stated. What symmetric group is this? Is it S_6? Is it a permutation group on a different set? The domain must be explicitly declared for the proof to be rigorous. Moreover, the relationship between the permutation domain and the elements of B_0 is not established.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
