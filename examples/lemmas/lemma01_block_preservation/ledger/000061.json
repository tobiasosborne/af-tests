Equivalently, x is fixed by σ if x does not appear in any cycle of the cycle decomposition of σ. In cycle notation, only elements explicitly appearing in a cycle are moved; all other elements of Ω are fixed. For example, (1 2 3) ∈ Sym({1,2,3,4,5,6}) fixes 4, 5, and 6.","created":"2026-01-17T18:49:56.378892902Z"}}
