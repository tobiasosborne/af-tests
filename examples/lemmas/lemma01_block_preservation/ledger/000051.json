To show h_3 'permutes' B_0, we need to establish that the induced map B -\u003e h_3(B) is a bijection on B_0. While the computation shows {1,4}-\u003e{1,4}, {2,5}-\u003e{3,6}, {3,6}-\u003e{2,5}, the proof does not explicitly verify that these three images are distinct (which would establish injectivity on a finite set). This should be stated explicitly.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
