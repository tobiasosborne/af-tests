However, node 1.4 (and the parent node 1) explicitly states h_3 = (5 6 2 3), which is a 4-cycle. These are fundamentally DIFFERENT permutations: (3 6) swaps 3↔6 and fixes everything else, while (5 6 2 3) sends 5→6→2→3→5. The definition provided does NOT match the permutation used in this proof. Similarly, the definition gives h₁ := (1 4) but the proof uses h_1 = (1 6 4 3), and h₂ := (2 5) but the proof uses h_2 = (1 2 4 5). The resolution of the original challenges by citing these definitions is INVALID because the definitions define entirely different mathematical objects. The correct definition should state h₃ := (5 6 2 3) as a 4-cycle, not (3 6) as a transposition.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
