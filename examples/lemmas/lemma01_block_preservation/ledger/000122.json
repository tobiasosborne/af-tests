Definitions have been added to the proof system (Cycle_Notation, Domain, Fixed_Points, Set_Action, Preserved_Setwise, Partition_B0, Permutations_h1_h2_h3), but node 1.4 does not explicitly DEPEND on them. The node metadata should include these definitions as formal dependencies so the proof structure correctly reflects the logical dependencies. Simply adding definitions to the system without linking them to the node that uses them does not establish proper proof structure.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
