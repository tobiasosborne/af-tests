In a rigorous proof system, the logical dependence on prior results must be explicitly declared. The inference should formally depend on the conclusions of nodes 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4. Without declared dependencies, this is logically a standalone assertion rather than an inference from established facts.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
