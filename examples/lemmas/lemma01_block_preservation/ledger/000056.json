These are different types of objects. Formally, we have h_3: X -\u003e X and an induced map h_3*: P(X) -\u003e P(X) defined by h_3*(S) = {h_3(x) : x in S}. The proof uses h_3 for both without distinguishing between the permutation and its induced action on the power set. This conflation, while common in informal mathematics, is a type error in a rigorous treatment.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
