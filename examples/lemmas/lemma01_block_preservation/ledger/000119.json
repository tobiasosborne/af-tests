While this challenge was marked resolved, examining the node shows the inference type is STILL 'assumption'. No structural change was made to the node. The correct inference type should be 'direct_computation' or 'calculation'. Resolving a challenge by citing definitions does NOT fix the fact that a computational proof is incorrectly classified as an assumption. The challenge was NOT properly addressed.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
