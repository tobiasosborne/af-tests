The node performs explicit computations (h_2(1) = 2, etc.) and derives a conclusion. This should have inference type 'direct_computation' or 'case_analysis' or similar, not 'assumption'. An assumption is an axiom or hypothesis that is taken as given without proof; this node presents a proof by computation.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
