This challenge was marked 'resolved' but the inference type is still listed as 'assumption'. This node should have inference type 'conclusion' or 'conjunction_introduction' since it combines the results of nodes 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4. The inference type has not actually been corrected.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
