What is the general principle being applied? The node should explicitly state: 'By definition of cycle notation, for any element x not appearing in the cycle (a_1 ... a_k), we have sigma(x) = x.' Then it must be verified that 3 and 6 do not appear in (1 2 4 5). This verification step (checking set membership) is implicit.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
