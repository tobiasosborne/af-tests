In the cycle (1 2 4 5), if we follow the standard convention that sigma(a_i) = a_{i+1}, then: (1) h_2(1) = 2 because 1 is followed by 2 in the cycle. (2) h_2(2) = 4 because 2 is followed by 4 in the cycle. (3) h_2(4) = 5 because 4 is followed by 5 in the cycle. (4) h_2(5) = 1 because 5 wraps around to 1. Each of these requires explicit verification that the reading convention is applied correctly. The proof just states the results without showing the derivation from the cycle definition.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
