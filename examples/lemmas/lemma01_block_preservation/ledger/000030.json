Running 'af defs' shows no definitions exist. The claim that 'h_3 permutes B_0' requires B_0 to be a well-defined mathematical object. What is B_0? Is it a set of sets? A partition? A family of subsets of what underlying set? Without a formal definition of B_0 in scope, the statement is not well-formed.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
