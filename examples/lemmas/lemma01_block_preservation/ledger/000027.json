This reasoning is invalid without first establishing: (1) What domain h_1 acts on (the proof never states that h_1 : {1,2,3,4,5,6} -\u003e {1,2,3,4,5,6}), and (2) The principle that elements not appearing in cycle notation are fixed. This principle requires proof or explicit citation. Why does absence from cycle notation imply fixation? This is a convention that MUST be stated.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
