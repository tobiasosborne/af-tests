The elements a₁, a₂, ..., aₖ must be distinct elements of Ω. The cycle has length k. Cycles are composed right-to-left: (1 2)(2 3) means first apply (2 3), then apply (1 2). Two cycles are disjoint if they share no common elements. Disjoint cycles commute.","created":"2026-01-17T18:49:51.899975942Z"}}
