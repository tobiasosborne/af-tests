The proof assumes readers understand that this notation denotes a permutation, but the precise semantics are not specified. Critical questions: (1) Does (5 6 2 3) mean 5→6, 6→2, 2→3, 3→5 or the reverse direction? (2) What is the domain of this permutation? (3) Is this a function from some set X to X? Without a formal definition in the proof's scope, this notation is undefined and the entire argument is based on undefined terms.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
