Is h_2(S) defined as {h_2(x) : x in S}? This must be stated explicitly. Furthermore, it must be proven that if sigma is a bijection on X, then sigma(S) := {sigma(x) : x in S} is a well-defined operation on subsets of X. The proof implicitly uses that sigma({a,b}) = {sigma(a), sigma(b)}, which requires the definition of pointwise action.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
