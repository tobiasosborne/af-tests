However, this node and its parent explicitly state h_1 = (1 6 4 3), which is a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT permutation (a 4-cycle). Under the 4-cycle (1 6 4 3): 1 -\u003e 6 -\u003e 4 -\u003e 3 -\u003e 1. Under the transposition (1 4): 1 -\u003e 4, 4 -\u003e 1, and 2,3,5,6 are fixed. These are mathematically incompatible. The challenges were supposedly resolved by citing definitions, but the cited definition CONTRADICTS the statement being proven. Either: (1) the definition is wrong and needs to be corrected, or (2) the proof statement is wrong and h_1 is actually (1 4) not (1 6 4 3), which would invalidate all computations. This error renders the entire proof meaningless. The resolution claiming 'definitions are now in scope' does NOT address this contradiction.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
