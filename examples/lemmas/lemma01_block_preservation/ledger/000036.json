The fixed-point behavior of elements not appearing in cycle notation must be explicitly defined. Convention varies in the literature (some authors use cycle notation only for the support, others define it differently). The proof must state: 'For elements x not appearing in a cycle c, we define c(x) = x.' Without this, the fixed-point claims are unjustified.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
