What does this notation mean? Is it left-to-right composition (1-\u003e6-\u003e4-\u003e3-\u003e1) or right-to-left? Different textbooks use different conventions. The proof system has NO definitions in scope (af defs returns empty). Without an explicit definition establishing the semantics of cycle notation, the claim h_1(1) = 6 is unjustified.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
