While the challenge was marked 'resolved', examining the node with 'af get 1.2' shows: 'Dependencies: (none)'. The node STILL has no dependencies declared. Resolving a challenge by adding definitions to the global scope does NOT fix the structural issue that this node should explicitly depend on definition nodes or the parent. The dependency structure is still malformed. The challenge was NOT properly addressed.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
