To permute a partition means to induce a bijection on the set of blocks. The proof shows: {1,4} -\u003e {3,6}, {2,5} -\u003e {2,5}, {3,6} -\u003e {1,4}. But it does not verify: (1) Each image is a member of B_0 (needs explicit check that {3,6}, {2,5}, {1,4} are all in B_0), (2) The induced map on blocks is a bijection (injectivity and surjectivity need verification). The statement 'maps B_0 to itself' is not sufficient.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
