But h_1 = (1 6 4 3) is a permutation of integers, not of sets or tuples. The correct statement would be: 'h_1 induces a bijection on B_0 such that...' or 'the action of h_1 on B_0 is...'. The current notation conflates the permutation h_1 on {1,...,6} with its induced action on the power set, which is a type error in rigorous mathematics.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
