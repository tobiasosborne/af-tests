The claim of bijectivity requires showing: (1) injectivity: distinct blocks map to distinct blocks, and (2) surjectivity: every block is in the image. While this follows from the fact that h_i is a permutation (hence bijective on the underlying set) and the images are shown to be blocks in B_0, this reasoning step is not made explicit. The jump from 'each block maps to a block' to 'bijectively maps the partition to itself' is a gap.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
