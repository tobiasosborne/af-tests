The arrow notation '({1,4}, {2,5}, {3,6}) -\u003e ({3,6}, {2,5}, {1,4})' appears to treat B_0 as an ordered 3-tuple, but the standard definition of partition preservation treats it as an unordered set. This notational ambiguity could mask important mathematical distinctions.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
