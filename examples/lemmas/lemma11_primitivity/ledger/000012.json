The proof used fixed-point arguments: if an element x is fixed by generator g and lies in block B, then x in g(B), which forces g(B) = B (not disjoint), eventually showing any block B must equal all of Omega.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"ed319fc7c1136e3b2c19715dbb9b2635eac182c708217d02715869b29ab632b4","created":"2026-01-18T08:21:36.615887009Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
