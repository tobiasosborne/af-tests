It states that a primitive permutation group containing a 3-cycle must contain the alternating group. This theorem is admitted as an axiom with references: (1) Jordan 1873, Bull. Soc. Math. France; (2) Wielandt 1964, Finite Permutation Groups, Thm 13.9; (3) Dixon-Mortimer 1996, Permutation Groups, Thm 3.3A. The proof involves showing that conjugates of the 3-cycle generate A_n, using primitivity to ensure these conjugates reach all of S_n's domain.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"0a6ab74673ed298fbb36ff34d39572bd0c7a764ba6af959ba4ccca56e48d51a1","created":"2026-01-18T08:37:51.133106464Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
