This creates structural redundancy in the proof tree - the same claims are made at this level and then repeated in more detail in the child nodes. Consider whether this node should: (a) only claim that 'each h_i permutes B_0 setwise' and defer the specific mappings to 1.2-1.4, or (b) be restructured so 1.2-1.4 are children that prove the individual cases claimed here.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
