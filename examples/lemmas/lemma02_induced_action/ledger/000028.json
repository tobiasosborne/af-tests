This requires showing: (1) the three transpositions are in Im(φ), and (2) there is no larger group containing these three transpositions that could be Im(φ). Point (2) is trivially satisfied since S_3 is already the full symmetric group on 3 elements, but this should be made explicit for clarity.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
