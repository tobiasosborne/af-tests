In general, two transpositions generate S_n only if they share exactly one element. A correct statement would be: 'Any two transpositions in S_3 that share exactly one element generate S_3' or 'The set of all three transpositions {(12), (13), (23)} generates S_3'. Since S_3 only has three transpositions total, and any two of them necessarily share an element, the statement happens to be true for S_3 but the justification is sloppy.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
