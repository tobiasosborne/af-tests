The 'af lemmas' command shows 'No lemmas extracted yet' and 'af externals' shows no external references. The claimed block permutation results need a valid source. Either: (1) 'Lemma 1' should be added as an external reference, (2) the block mappings should be derived directly from definitions Permutations_h1_h2_h3 and Set_Action without citing a non-existent lemma, or (3) an actual lemma should be extracted/added to the framework.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
