## Node 1

**Statement:** Let G <= S_n be primitive with n >= 5. If G contains a 3-cycle, then G >= A_n. (Jordan's Theorem - admitted as axiom)

**Type:** claim

**Inference:** assumption

**Status:** admitted

**Taint:** self_admitted

### Node 1.1

**Statement:** AXIOM ADMISSION: Jordan's Theorem is a classical result in permutation group theory, first proven by Camille Jordan in 1873. It states that a primitive permutation group containing a 3-cycle must contain the alternating group. This theorem is admitted as an axiom with references: (1) Jordan 1873, Bull. Soc. Math. France; (2) Wielandt 1964, Finite Permutation Groups, Thm 13.9; (3) Dixon-Mortimer 1996, Permutation Groups, Thm 3.3A. The proof involves showing that conjugates of the 3-cycle generate A_n, using primitivity to ensure these conjugates reach all of S_n's domain.
