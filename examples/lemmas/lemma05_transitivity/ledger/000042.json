The conclusion correctly synthesizes results from nodes 1.2-1.6 to establish that Gamma is connected, and properly applies Graph_Connectivity to conclude that H acts transitively on Omega. Two minor/note-level challenges were raised regarding (1) missing formal dependencies and (2) inference type classification, but these are organizational concerns that do not affect the validity of the proof."}
