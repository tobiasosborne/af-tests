While node 1.6 can derive its content directly from the generator definitions in the parent node 1, adding dependencies on 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 would make the relationship explicit and clarify the proof structure. Not critical since the parent node contains sufficient information.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
