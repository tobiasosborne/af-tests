By nodes 1.2-1.4, we have identified all edges from generators g_1, g_2, g_3. By node 1.5, the Core forms a connected subgraph. By node 1.6, every tail vertex (a_i, b_j, c_ℓ) is connected to the Core via a path. Since every vertex in Ω = Core ∪ {a_i} ∪ {b_j} ∪ {c_ℓ} is connected to the Core, and the Core is connected, Γ is connected. By Definition (Graph_Connectivity), since Γ is connected, H = ⟨g_1, g_2, g_3⟩ acts transitively on Ω.
