From g_1: edges {1,6}, {6,4}, {4,3}. From g_2: edges {1,2}, {2,4}, {4,5}. From g_3: edges {5,6}, {6,2}, {2,3}. Starting from vertex 1, we can reach: 6 via {1,6}; 4 via {6,4}; 3 via {4,3}; 2 via {1,2}; 5 via {4,5}. Thus all six Core vertices are connected.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"5f44080b46ad07579b68af9a08e09fec2e71f3a9eea18f3c91c75d4dfb971b62","created":"2026-01-17T20:23:40.037241509Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
