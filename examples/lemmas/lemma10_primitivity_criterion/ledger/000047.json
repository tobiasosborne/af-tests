A transitive subgroup H of a transitive group G need not equal G (e.g., A_n \u003c S_n are both transitive). The correct argument should invoke the Block-Stabilizer Correspondence: since the correspondence is bijective and G·α = Ω, the unique subgroup K with G_α ≤ K ≤ G satisfying K·α = Ω is K = G. Since H·α = Ω, by bijectivity, H = G.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
