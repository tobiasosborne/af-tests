(2) Orbit 1: 1-\u003e7-\u003e5-\u003e1 forms 3-cycle (1 7 5). (3) Orbit 2: 2-\u003e4-\u003e6-\u003e2 forms 3-cycle (2 4 6). (4) Orbit 3: 3 is fixed. (5) DISCREPANCY CONFIRMED: Computed result (1 7 5)(2 4 6) differs from original claim (1 2 6)(3 4 5). The computed traces are mathematically correct."}
