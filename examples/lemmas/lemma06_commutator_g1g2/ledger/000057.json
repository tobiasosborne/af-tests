{"type":"node_validated","timestamp":"2026-01-17T20:42:05.590220506Z","node_id":"1.1","note":"The overview correctly describes the approach: computing [g_1, g_2] = g_1^{-1} g_2^{-1} g_1 g_2 by tracing all 7 elements. The functional composition convention (sigma tau)(x) = sigma(tau(x)) correctly implies applying right-to-left, so [g_1, g_2](x) = g_1^{-1}(g_2^{-1}(g_1(g_2(x)))) is consistent with g_1^{-1} g_2^{-1} g_1 g_2. The described methodology matches nodes 1.4-1.10."}
