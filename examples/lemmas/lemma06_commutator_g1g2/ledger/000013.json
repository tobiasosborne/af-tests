Applying this: g_1 = (1 6 4 3 7) has inverse (7 3 4 6 1), which in standard form is g_1^{-1} = (1 7 3 4 6). Similarly, g_2 = (1 2 4 5) has inverse (5 4 2 1), which in standard form is g_2^{-1} = (1 5 4 2). These match the given definitions.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"d4049d4e3768d36a93bdace32ec0b0fc2f158e1f1ceb6c946aed61702ca2d569","created":"2026-01-17T20:36:15.518068981Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
