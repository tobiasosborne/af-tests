This gives cycles (1 6 2)(3 5 4), which is the INVERSE of (1 2 6)(3 4 5). This confirms that if the expected answer (1 2 6)(3 4 5) is correct, then the commutator definition should be [g_1, g_2] = g_1 g_2 g_1^{-1} g_2^{-1}, not the one stated in the Commutator definition.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"39dd29fdc06583ffc5a5c0cc2f227fef7848aced45612be0d14b0eeacdeabdeb","created":"2026-01-17T20:37:28.147332867Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
