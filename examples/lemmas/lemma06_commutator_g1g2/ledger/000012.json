Using the convention that (sigma tau)(x) = sigma(tau(x)), we compute [g_1, g_2](x) = g_1^{-1}(g_2^{-1}(g_1(g_2(x)))) for each x. We identify the orbits and express the result in disjoint cycle notation.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"ccd11a487432faf75da42d6a383cd3d42c3e1b354d3de7f9a3627260409d5dc7","created":"2026-01-17T20:36:09.145976517Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
