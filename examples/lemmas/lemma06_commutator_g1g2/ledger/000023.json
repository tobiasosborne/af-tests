Identifying orbits: Orbit 1: 1-\u003e7-\u003e5-\u003e1 (3-cycle). Orbit 2: 2-\u003e4-\u003e6-\u003e2 (3-cycle). Orbit 3: 3-\u003e3 (fixed point). In cycle notation: [g_1, g_2] = (1 7 5)(2 4 6). IMPORTANT DISCREPANCY: The computed result (1 7 5)(2 4 6) differs from the claimed (1 2 6)(3 4 5). The computation has been verified step-by-step. Either the original claim contains an error, or a different commutator convention was intended.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"ffd4e38e056b24029fba3a671ee3c03df89b3d63ddc4f061b791f69e97be506d","created":"2026-01-17T20:37:20.740045778Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
