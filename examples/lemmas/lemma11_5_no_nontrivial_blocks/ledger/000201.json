The conclusion that Case 1a-ii is impossible is sound. The broader claims about Case 1a (combining 1a-i and 1a-ii) and Case 1 (combining 1a and 1b) being impossible are correctly derived from validated nodes 1.5, 1.7, and 1.9.6. Minor challenge raised about explicit dependency listing (ch-0da5e4742997aa01), but this does not affect the mathematical validity of the argument."}
