Node 1.2 established that B contains supp(g_1) = {1,3,4,6,a_1,...,a_n}. The elements {3,6,a_1,...,a_n} are NOT in supp(g_2), so they are fixed by g_2. If x is fixed by g_2 and x is in B, then g_2(x) = x is in g_2(B), so x is in both B and g_2(B). This contradicts B ∩ g_2(B) = empty. Specifically: 3 is in B (from 1.2), 3 is not in supp(g_2)={1,2,4,5,b_i}, so g_2(3)=3, hence 3 is in g_2(B), contradicting disjointness. Case 1b (g_1(B)=B AND g_2(B)!=B) is logically impossible when supp(g_1) contains elements outside supp(g_2).","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
