The claim that 'B and g_3(B) must have EQUAL size (as blocks in orbit)' and then comparing |B| = 6+n+k vs |g_3(B)| = 4 is wrong because |g_3(B)| = |B| ALWAYS (bijection). The 4 elements only count g_3(B) ∩ supp(g_3), not all of g_3(B). The ACTUAL contradiction comes earlier: g_3 fixes 1, 4, a_i, b_j (not in supp(g_3)), so these stay in g_3(B) causing B ∩ g_3(B) ≠ ∅, violating block disjointness. The entire partition argument is based on a category error confusing g_3(B) with g_3(B) ∩ supp(g_3).","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
