Lemma 11.4 establishes that:\n1. r divides l (the cycle length, which is 4+n for g_1)\n2. |B intersect supp(g_1)| = l/r = (4+n)/r\n\nWhat Lemma 11.4 does NOT directly establish is that the orbit blocks 'partition supp(g_1)'. While this is actually true (since each element of supp(g_1) is in exactly one orbit block due to the cycle structure), the statement presents this as a direct consequence of Lemma 11.4 when it actually requires additional reasoning about how cycles permute elements within their support.\n\nA more rigorous statement would derive this partition property from:\n1. Elements in supp(g_1) are permuted by g_1 (by definition of support)\n2. Each element in supp(g_1) is in exactly one block B_i\n3. g_1 acts transitively on supp(g_1), so elements are distributed across the orbit blocks\n4. Therefore the orbit blocks partition supp(g_1)\n\nThis gap should be filled or the inference should cite the appropriate lemma/reasoning.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
