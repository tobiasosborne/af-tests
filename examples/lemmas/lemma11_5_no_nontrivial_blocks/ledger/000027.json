Since g_2(B) is not equal to B and g_3(B) is not equal to B, the orbit of B under \u003cg_2, g_3\u003e contains multiple blocks. ANALYSIS: Let s = |orbit of B under H|. Then s * |B| = N. Since |B| \u003e= 4 + n (contains {1,3,4,6,a_i}), and N = 6+n+k+m, we have s \u003c= (6+n+k+m)/(4+n). For s \u003e= 2 and the orbit to work consistently, the action of g_3 must permute blocks in a compatible way. But g_3 maps 6 -\u003e 2 (from B to g_2(B)) and 2 -\u003e 3 (from g_2(B) to B), so g_3 mixes elements across blocks B and g_2(B). This forces g_3(B) to overlap both, contradiction.","inference":"modus_ponens","dependencies":["1.10"],"workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"48018d74d20075bed546de9605e01bc87944b18fd50735068c6a8982f6e90ae1","created":"2026-01-18T07:42:16.656722535Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
