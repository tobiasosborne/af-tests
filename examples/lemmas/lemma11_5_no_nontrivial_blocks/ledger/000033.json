Say 1 is in g_1^j(B) and 4 is in g_1^l(B) with j \\!= l. Then g_2(1) = 2 and g_2(4) = 5. Since g_2 maps 1 (in g_1^j(B)) to 2 (in g_2(g_1^j(B))) and maps 4 (in g_1^l(B)) to 5 (in g_2(g_1^l(B))), the action of g_2 permutes the g_1-orbit blocks. KEY: In the cycle g_1 = (1 6 4 3 a_1 ... a_n), note that g_1(1) = 6, g_1(6) = 4, g_1(4) = 3, g_1(3) = a_1. So if orbit size r = 2, each block has (4+n)/2 elements. Elements 1, 4 separated means they're in different blocks. But g_1^2(1) = 4 (since g_1(1) = 6, g_1(6) = 4). So 1 and 4 are in same g_1^2 orbit, meaning same block for r = 2.
