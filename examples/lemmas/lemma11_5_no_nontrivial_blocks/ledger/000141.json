So B intersect supp(g_3) = {2,3,5,6} exactly, meaning NO c_i are in B. Then all c_1,...,c_4 must be in g_3(B). PARTITION ANALYSIS: Omega = 6 + n + k + 4 = 10 + n + k elements. B contains {1,2,3,4,5,6,a_1,...,a_n,b_1,...,b_k} = 6+n+k elements. g_3(B) contains {c_1,c_2,c_3,c_4} = 4 elements. But |B| + |g_3(B)| = (6+n+k) + 4 = 10+n+k = N. This means {B, g_3(B)} partitions Omega, so there are only 2 blocks. However, B and g_3(B) must have EQUAL size (as blocks in orbit). |B| = 6+n+k but |g_3(B)| = 4. CONTRADICTION unless n = k = 0, but we assumed n \u003e= 1.","new_statement":"CASE 1a-ii CONCLUSION: Node 1.7 establishes that Case 1a-ii is IMPOSSIBLE via the fixed-point argument. To summarize: In Case 1a-ii, B contains {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, a_i, b_j} and we assume g_3(B) != B (hence g_3(B) disjoint from B). But g_3 FIXES elements outside supp(g_3) = {2,3,5,6,c_l}. Specifically, g_3(1) = 1 and g_3(4) = 4 and g_3(a_i) = a_i and g_3(b_j) = b_j. Since 1 is in B, we have g_3(1) = 1 is in g_3(B), so 1 is in B cap g_3(B), contradicting disjointness. CONCLUSION: Case 1a-ii cannot occur. Combined with Case 1a-i (which also gives contradiction by B = Omega), we conclude Case 1a is impossible. Combined with Case 1b impossibility (node 1.9.6), we conclude Case 1 (g_1(B) = B) always leads to contradiction. The only remaining case is Case 2 (g_1(B) != B), addressed in nodes 1.9.1ff.","owner":"prover-2"}
