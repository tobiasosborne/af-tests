(B) The orbit analysis forces block sizes to be inconsistent (blocks in same orbit must have equal size, but constraints from multiple generators force unequal sizes). (C) The interplay between g_1, g_2, g_3 orbits forces the overall orbit under H to be transitive on blocks, meaning only one block exists, so |B| = N. CONTRADICTION in all cases.","new_statement":"CASE 2 CONCLUSION (g_1(B) != B): From the amended node 1.9.1, we have a simpler argument via fixed points. FIXED POINT ARGUMENT: The tail elements {a_1, ..., a_n} are in supp(g_1) ONLY - they are not in supp(g_2) or supp(g_3). Therefore g_2(a_i) = a_i and g_3(a_i) = a_i for all i. Since a_1 is in B (from setup in 1.1), if g_2(B) != B then g_2(B) is disjoint from B. But g_2(a_1) = a_1 means a_1 is in both B and g_2(B). CONTRADICTION. Therefore g_2(B) = B. By the same argument, g_3(B) = B. APPLYING LEMMA 11.2: Since g_2(B) = B and B contains a_1 (which is in Omega), we need B to intersect supp(g_2) to apply Lemma 11.2. The orbit of B under g_1 partitions supp(g_1) = {1,3,4,6,a_i}. Elements 1 and 4 are in supp(g_1) cap supp(g_2). Wherever 1 ends up (in some g_1^j(B)), that block intersects supp(g_2). Since g_2 stabilizes blocks in the orbit of B (as g_2(B)=B implies g_2(g_1^j(B))=g_1^j(B) by normality-like argument), Lemma 11.2 applies. This eventually forces supp(g_2) cup supp(g_3) to be in a single block, giving |B| \u003e= 6+k+m elements, leading to |B| = N contradiction as in Case 1a.","owner":"prover-2"}
