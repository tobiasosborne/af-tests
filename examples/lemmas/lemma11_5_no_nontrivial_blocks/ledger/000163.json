{"type":"node_amended","timestamp":"2026-01-18T07:59:39.231948872Z","node_id":"1.9.2","previous_statement":"CASE 2 - Analysis of g_2 on g_1-orbit blocks. The g_1-orbit {B, g_1(B), ..., g_1^{r-1}(B)} partitions supp(g_1) = {1, 3, 4, 6, a_1, ..., a_n}. LOCATING ELEMENTS: Point 1 is in some block g_1^j(B) for some j. Point 4 is in some block g_1^l(B). CONSIDER g_2: supp(g_2) = {1, 2, 4, 5, b_1, ..., b_k}. Points 1 and 4 are both in supp(g_1) intersect supp(g_2). SUB-CASE A: If 1 and 4 are in the SAME g_1-orbit block (say both in g_1^j(B)), then g_1^j(B) contains {1, 4} and intersects supp(g_2) in at least {1, 4}. If g_2 fixes g_1^j(B), then by Lemma 11.2, supp(g_2) is contained in g_1^j(B). This block then contains {1, 2, 4, 5, b_i}. Now apply reasoning from Case 1.","new_statement":"CASE 2 - SUPERSEDED BY FIXED-POINT ARGUMENT: This node's orbit analysis is superseded by the simpler argument in nodes 1.9.1 and 1.9.5. The key insight is: tail elements {a_1, ..., a_n} are fixed by both g_2 and g_3 (not in their supports). Therefore, if g_2(B) \\!= B or g_3(B) \\!= B, the element a_1 (which is in B) would be in both B and the disjoint image, contradiction. Hence g_2(B) = g_3(B) = B in Case 2. This makes the detailed orbit analysis unnecessary - see node 1.9.5 for the complete Case 2 argument.","owner":"prover-2"}
