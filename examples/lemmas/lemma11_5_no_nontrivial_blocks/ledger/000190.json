Key verification: (1) Elements {1,4,a_i,b_j} are correctly identified as NOT in supp(g_3)={2,3,5,6,c_l}. (2) By definition of support, g_3 fixes these elements. (3) Since 1 is in B and g_3(1)=1, we have 1 in g_3(B). (4) This proves B cap g_3(B) is non-empty, contradicting disjointness. The argument elegantly bypasses complex orbit analysis and provides immediate contradiction."}
