Therefore, node 1.9.1 MUST declare a dependency on node 1.1.\n\nAdditionally, the claim relies on the definition of g_1 to establish that a_1 is in supp(g_1), which should be referenced via the g_1 definition.\n\nWithout proper dependency declarations, the logical structure of the proof is incomplete and cannot be properly verified for soundness.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
