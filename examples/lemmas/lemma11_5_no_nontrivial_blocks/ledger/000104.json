The r=2 contradiction argument is valid: when r=2, elements x and g_1^2(x) must be in the same block, so 1 and 4 would be in the same block, contradicting Sub-case B's assumption that they are in different blocks. Minor note: the 'Contradiction' is correctly scoped to r=2, with r\u003e=3 handled in node 1.9.4."}
