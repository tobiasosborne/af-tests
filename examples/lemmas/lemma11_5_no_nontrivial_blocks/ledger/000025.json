CURRENT STATE: B contains {1, 3, 4, 6, a_i}, g_2(B) contains {2, 5}, and B intersect g_2(B) = empty. KEY OBSERVATION: supp(g_3) = {2, 3, 5, 6, c_1, ..., c_m}. Elements 3, 6 are in B. Elements 2, 5 are in g_2(B). So supp(g_3) intersects BOTH B and g_2(B) non-trivially. CONTRAPOSITIVE OF LEMMA 11.2: If g_3 fixes B setwise (g_3(B) = B), then since supp(g_3) intersects B, we need supp(g_3) contained in B. But 2, 5 are in supp(g_3) and 2, 5 are in g_2(B) which is disjoint from B. So supp(g_3) is NOT contained in B. CONCLUSION: g_3(B) is not equal to B.","inference":"modus_tollens","dependencies":["1.9"],"workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"cf0cf12e24bff119d815e6e09e3b0b229a6a409bb3b5d30f3b42a8104509ea74","created":"2026-01-18T07:41:38.413267884Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
