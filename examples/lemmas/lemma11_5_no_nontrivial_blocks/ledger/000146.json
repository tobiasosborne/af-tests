But {3,6} is in supp(g_3) and {3,6} is in B which is disjoint from g_2(B). Contradiction. So g_3 moves both B and g_2(B) to different blocks. This means the orbit of B under \u003cg_2,g_3\u003e has size \u003e= 3. Continuing this analysis: every generator moves B non-trivially except g_1. The orbit under H grows until it covers all of Omega, forcing |B| = N. CONTRADICTION.","new_statement":"CASE 1b CONCLUSION - SUPERSEDED: This node is superseded by node 1.9.6 which proves Case 1b is IMPOSSIBLE. The impossibility follows from the fixed-point argument: elements {3, 6, a_1, ..., a_n} in B are fixed by g_2 (not in supp(g_2)), so if g_2(B) != B (disjoint), then 3 is in both B and g_2(B), contradiction. Therefore Case 1b (g_1(B)=B AND g_2(B)!=B) cannot occur when n \u003e= 1. The analysis in this subtree (1.10, 1.10.1, 1.10.2) is vacuously true since Case 1b is impossible. Case 1 reduces entirely to Case 1a.","owner":"prover-2"}
