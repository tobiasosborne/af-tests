While the FIXED-POINT ARGUMENT for forcing g_2(B) = B and g_3(B) = B is CORRECT, the supersession reference to node 1.9.5 is problematic.\n\nNode 1.9.5 contains a CRITICAL GAP in applying Lemma 11.2 after establishing g_2(B) = g_3(B) = B. The gap concerns whether B intersects supp(g_2) or supp(g_3), which is NOT guaranteed in Case 2 when g_1(B) != B.\n\nThe supersession claim is only partially valid: the fixed-point argument showing g_2(B) = B is correct, but the complete Case 2 argument in 1.9.5 is incomplete. This node should either:\n(1) Be marked as superseded by 1.9.1 ONLY (for the fixed-point part), OR\n(2) Acknowledge that the Case 2 conclusion in 1.9.5 needs further work.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
