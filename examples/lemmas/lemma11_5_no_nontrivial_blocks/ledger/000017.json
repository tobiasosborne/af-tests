By Lemma 11.3 (tail in block implies support in block): Since a_1 is in B and g_1(B) = B, we conclude supp(g_1) = {1, 3, 4, 6, a_1, ..., a_n} is contained in B. EXPLICIT CONTENTS: B now contains at minimum {1, 3, 4, 6, a_1, ..., a_n}. In particular, the core points 1, 3, 4, 6 are all in B.","inference":"local_assume","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"b1920d7fd6799cdac480abab533a1697101ba2560efe09aca79ca8e780ea0dda","created":"2026-01-18T07:40:30.362781121Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
