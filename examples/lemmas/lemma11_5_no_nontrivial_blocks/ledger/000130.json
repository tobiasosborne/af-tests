{"type":"node_amended","timestamp":"2026-01-18T07:56:08.071284369Z","node_id":"1.9.1","previous_statement":"CASE 2 - Assume g_1(B) is not equal to B. SETUP: Since a_1 is in B and a_1 is in supp(g_1), we have B intersects supp(g_1) non-trivially. By block property, since g_1(B) is not equal to B, we have g_1(B) disjoint from B. The orbit of B under \u003cg_1\u003e has size r \u003e 1 where r divides |supp(g_1)| = 4+n. APPLICATION OF LEMMA 11.4: |B intersect supp(g_1)| = (4+n)/r \u003e= 1 (since a_1 is in B intersect supp(g_1)). The orbit {B, g_1(B), g_1^2(B), ..., g_1^{r-1}(B)} consists of r disjoint blocks that together partition supp(g_1) = {1, 3, 4, 6, a_1, ..., a_n}.","new_statement":"STRUCTURAL NOTE: This node and siblings 1.9.2-1.9.5 were originally labeled as 'Case 2' but incorrectly placed under node 1.9 (Case 1b). Node 1.9.6 establishes that Case 1b is IMPOSSIBLE, making this subtree unnecessary for Case 1b. The Case 2 analysis (g_1(B) \\!= B) is now handled separately. CASE 2 ANALYSIS (g_1(B) \\!= B): Since a_1 is in B and a_1 is in supp(g_1), B intersects supp(g_1). Since g_1(B) \\!= B, g_1(B) is disjoint from B. FIXED POINT ARGUMENT: Elements {a_1, ..., a_n} are ONLY in supp(g_1) - they are NOT in supp(g_2) or supp(g_3). Therefore g_2(a_i) = a_i and g_3(a_i) = a_i for all i. CONSEQUENCE: If g_2(B) \\!= B, then g_2(B) disjoint from B, but g_2(a_1) = a_1 means a_1 in both B and g_2(B). CONTRADICTION. Therefore g_2(B) = B. Similarly g_3(B) = B. So in Case 2, we have g_1(B) \\!= B but g_2(B) = g_3(B) = B.","owner":"prover-2"}
