The fixed-point argument is correctly summarized: elements {3,6,a_i} are fixed by g_2 (not in supp(g_2)), so if g_2(B)\\!=B (disjoint), then 3 is in both B and g_2(B), contradiction. The claim that Case 1b analysis is 'vacuously true' is mathematically sound since Case 1b is proven impossible in 1.9.6 (now validated). Minor note raised about implicit dependency on 1.9.6."}
