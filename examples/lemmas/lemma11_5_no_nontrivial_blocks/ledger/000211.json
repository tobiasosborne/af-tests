Element a_1 is NOT in supp(g_2). The argument then asserts a 'normality-like' stabilization g_2(g_1^j(B)) = g_1^j(B), but this is UNJUSTIFIED - g_1 and g_2 do not commute.\n\nRIGOROUS ANALYSIS shows B may NOT intersect supp(g_2):\n\n(1) Elements outside supp(g_1) = {2, 5, b_j, c_l} are FIXED by g_1, hence live in g_1-fixed blocks.\n\n(2) In Case 2, g_1(B) != B, so B is NOT g_1-fixed. Therefore B contains NONE of {2, 5, b_j, c_l}.\n\n(3) supp(g_2) = {1, 2, 4, 5, b_j}. Since {2, 5, b_j} are not in B, we have B cap supp(g_2) = B cap {1, 4}.\n\n(4) Elements 1 and 4 are in specific g_1-orbit positions relative to a_1:\n    - g_1^{-4}(a_1) = 1, so 1 is in g_1^{-4}(B)\n    - g_1^{-2}(a_1) = 4, so 4 is in g_1^{-2}(B)\n\n(5) For n=1: cycle length is 5, orbit size r divides 5, so r in {1,5}. Since r \u003e 1 (Case 2), r = 5. Then g_1^{-2}(B) != B and g_1^{-4}(B) != B (since 2 and 4 do not divide 5).\n\n(6) THEREFORE for n=1: Neither 1 nor 4 is in B, hence B cap supp(g_2) = empty!\n\nWithout B intersecting supp(g_2), Lemma 11.2 CANNOT be applied. The Case 2 argument has a fundamental gap.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
