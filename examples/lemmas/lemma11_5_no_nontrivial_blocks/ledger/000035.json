(B) The orbit analysis forces block sizes to be inconsistent (blocks in same orbit must have equal size, but constraints from multiple generators force unequal sizes). (C) The interplay between g_1, g_2, g_3 orbits forces the overall orbit under H to be transitive on blocks, meaning only one block exists, so |B| = N.
