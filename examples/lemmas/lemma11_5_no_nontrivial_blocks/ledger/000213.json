In Case 2 with g_1(B) != B, elements {2, 5, b_j, c_l} are in g_1-fixed blocks while B is g_1-moved, so B cannot contain these elements. For n = 1, the orbit size is 5, and B does not contain 1 or 4 either. Hence B may not intersect supp(g_2) at all.\n\nThe supersession claim is valid for the fixed-point part (referenced from 1.9.1) but the 'complete Case 2 argument' in 1.9.5 remains incomplete. This node should clarify the status of the Case 2 conclusion.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
