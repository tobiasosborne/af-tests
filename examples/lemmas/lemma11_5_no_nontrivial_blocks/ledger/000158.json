CASE 1 (g_1(B) = B): CASE 1a (g_2(B) = B): Both subcases (g_3(B) = B and g_3(B) != B) lead to contradiction. CASE 1b (g_2(B) != B): Leads to contradiction via orbit growth analysis. CASE 2 (g_1(B) != B): All subcases lead to contradiction. FINAL RESULT: Our assumption that a non-trivial H-invariant block system exists is FALSE. Therefore, when n + k + m \u003e= 1, the group H = \u003cg_1, g_2, g_3\u003e admits NO non-trivial block system on Omega.

CASE 1a (g_2(B) = B): B contains {1,2,3,4,5,6,a_i,b_j} (nodes 1.3-1.4). Case 1a-i (g_3(B)=B): B=Omega, contradiction (node 1.5). Case 1a-ii (g_3(B)!=B): Elements {1,4,a_i,b_j} fixed by g_3 contradict disjointness (node 1.7). CASE 1b (g_2(B)!=B): IMPOSSIBLE - elements {3,6,a_i} fixed by g_2 contradict disjointness (node 1.9.6). CASE 2 (g_1(B)!=B): Tail elements {a_i} fixed by g_2 and g_3 force g_2(B)=g_3(B)=B; then Lemma 11.2 forces supports into B, giving |B|=N (node 1.9.5). All cases lead to contradiction.
