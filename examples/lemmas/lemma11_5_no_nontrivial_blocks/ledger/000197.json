However, this is acceptable since: (1) 1.9.6 is now validated, (2) the supersession statement correctly summarizes the fixed-point argument from 1.9.6, and (3) the claim that Case 1b analysis is 'vacuously true' is mathematically sound - any statement under an impossible hypothesis is vacuously valid.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
