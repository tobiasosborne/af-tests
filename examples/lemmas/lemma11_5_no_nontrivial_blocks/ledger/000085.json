The node confuses g_3(B) with g_3(B) ∩ supp(g_3). More fundamentally: g_3 FIXES elements outside supp(g_3). Since 1, 4, a_i, b_j are not in supp(g_3), we have g_3(1) = 1, g_3(4) = 4, etc. Therefore, if 1 ∈ B then 1 ∈ g_3(B), so B ∩ g_3(B) contains {1, 4, a_i, b_j} ≠ ∅. This contradicts that B and g_3(B) are disjoint blocks. THIS is the real contradiction but it occurs EARLIER than the stated partition argument.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
