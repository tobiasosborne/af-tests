This is acceptable since: (1) 1.9.6 is now validated and proves Case 1b is impossible, (2) the supersession statement correctly summarizes the fixed-point contradiction, and (3) the claim that Case 1 reduces entirely to Case 1a follows logically from 1.9.6's proof that Case 1b cannot occur.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
