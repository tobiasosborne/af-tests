Node 1.9 establishes B contains supp(g_1) = {1,3,4,6,a_1,...,a_n} where n \u003e= 1 (assumed in 1.1 WLOG). The a_i elements are NOT in supp(g_2) = {1,2,4,5,b_1,...,b_k}, so g_2(a_i) = a_i for all i. Therefore g_2(B) contains g_2(a_1) = a_1. But a_1 is also in B. This means a_1 is in B ∩ g_2(B), contradicting the claim in 1.9 that B ∩ g_2(B) = empty. The entire Case 1b analysis is built on an impossible configuration. Either n = 0 must hold (contradicting the n \u003e= 1 assumption) or g_2(B) = B (Case 1a, not Case 1b).","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
