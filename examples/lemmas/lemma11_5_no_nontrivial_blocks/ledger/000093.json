Node 1.1 (direct dependency): Has open challenge ch-08e1cde4d4da3587 regarding the unjustified WLOG assumption 'n \u003e= 1'. The hypothesis is 'n + k + m \u003e= 1' which does NOT reduce to n \u003e= 1 WLOG since the generators have asymmetric pairwise support intersections.\n\n2. Node 1.8 (direct dependency): Depends on 1.7 which has open challenge ch-411a45d3923 about incomplete case analysis for m \u003e= 4 (only r=2 is analyzed, not r=3,4,...).\n\n3. Node 1.10.2 (direct dependency): Depends on 1.10, and node 1.10.1 (in the Case 1b subtree) has open challenges ch-eea11dfe247d62bb and ch-ead6a3afa556c6ab regarding logical gaps in the orbit mixing argument.\n\n4. Node 1.9.5 (direct dependency): The Case 2 CONCLUSION depends implicitly on 1.9.2, 1.9.3, 1.9.4, and node 1.9.4 has open challenges ch-aacbc3eee1927c6e and ch-665be973c7dc826f about gaps in the orbit analysis.\n\nThe QED cannot be validated while 4 nodes in the dependency chain have 7 open MAJOR challenges. All case analyses must be complete and verified before accepting the overall conclusion.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
