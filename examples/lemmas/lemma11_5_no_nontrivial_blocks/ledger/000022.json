SUBCASE m \u003c= 3: If m \u003c= 3, then 1 + m/4 \u003c 2, so r \u003c 2. But r must be a positive integer \u003e 1 (since g_3(B) is not equal to B), so r \u003e= 2. CONTRADICTION for m \u003c= 3. SUBCASE m \u003e= 4: If r = 2, then |B intersect supp(g_3)| = (4+m)/2 \u003e= 4 (verified). The g_3-orbit of B has exactly 2 blocks: {B, g_3(B)}. These partition supp(g_3). CRITICAL OBSERVATION: B contains {1,2,3,4,5,6,a_i,b_j} which has size 6+n+k. Since g_3(B) is disjoint from B and both partition supp(g_3) = {2,3,5,6,c_1,...,c_m}, elements {2,3,5,6} are in B but c_i must be split. However, B already contains 2,3,5,6 so |B intersect supp(g_3)| \u003e= 4 = (4+m)/2 implies m \u003c= 4.","inference":"modus_ponens","dependencies":["1.6"],"workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"414116f8671b4de24134611f2137d7ef4c2f71f50aba6397cf1d61bdd4d09373","created":"2026-01-18T07:41:10.055951305Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
