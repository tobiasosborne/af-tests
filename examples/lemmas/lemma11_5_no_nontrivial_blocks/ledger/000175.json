Since g_2(B) is not equal to B and g_3(B) is not equal to B, the orbit of B under \u003cg_2, g_3\u003e contains multiple blocks. ANALYSIS: Let s = |orbit of B under H|. Then s * |B| = N. Since |B| \u003e= 4 + n (contains {1,3,4,6,a_i}), and N = 6+n+k+m, we have s \u003c= (6+n+k+m)/(4+n). For s \u003e= 2 and the orbit to work consistently, the action of g_3 must permute blocks in a compatible way. But g_3 maps 6 -\u003e 2 (from B to g_2(B)) and 2 -\u003e 3 (from g_2(B) to B), so g_3 mixes elements across blocks B and g_2(B). This forces g_3(B) to overlap both, contradiction.","new_statement":"CASE 1b ORBIT ANALYSIS - SUPERSEDED: This node's orbit growth argument is superseded by node 1.9.6 which proves Case 1b is IMPOSSIBLE. The impossibility follows from the fixed-point argument: elements {3, 6, a_1, ..., a_n} in B are fixed by g_2 (not in supp(g_2)), so if g_2(B) \\!= B then 3 is in both B and g_2(B), contradicting disjointness. Since Case 1b cannot occur, this orbit analysis is vacuously true. See node 1.9.6 for the proof of Case 1b impossibility.","owner":"prover-2"}
