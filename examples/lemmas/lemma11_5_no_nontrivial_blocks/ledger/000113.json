These lemmas should be formally declared as external dependencies: Lemma 11.2 (cycle stabilizer implies support containment), Lemma 11.3 (tail in block implies support in block), and Lemma 11.4 (orbit-block size relationship). Without these declared externals, the proof's logical chain is incomplete.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
