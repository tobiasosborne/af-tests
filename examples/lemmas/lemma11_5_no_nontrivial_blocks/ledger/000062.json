The argument only considers r = 2, but for m \u003e= 4 we have r \u003c= 1 + m/4, which allows r \u003e 2. For example: if m = 8, then r \u003c= 3, so r could be 2 or 3. If m = 12, then r \u003c= 4, so r could be 2, 3, or 4 (subject to divisibility). The proof must either: (1) show that r \u003e 2 leads to contradiction, or (2) analyze all possible values of r that divide (4+m) and satisfy r \u003c= 1 + m/4. Currently, the r = 3, 4, etc. cases are not addressed, leaving a logical gap.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
