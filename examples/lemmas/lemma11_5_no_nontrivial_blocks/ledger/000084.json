What happens if 1 and 4 are in the same block g_1^j(B) but g_2(g_1^j(B)) \\!= g_1^j(B)? In this case, g_2 maps the block containing {1,4} to a different block. This sub-sub-case is not analyzed. The statement says 'If g_2 fixes g_1^j(B), then...' but never addresses the alternative where g_2 does NOT fix it.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
