CASE 1 (g_1(B) = B): CASE 1a (g_2(B) = B): Both subcases (g_3(B) = B and g_3(B) != B) lead to contradiction. CASE 1b (g_2(B) != B): Leads to contradiction via orbit growth analysis. CASE 2 (g_1(B) != B): All subcases lead to contradiction. FINAL RESULT: Our assumption that a non-trivial H-invariant block system exists is FALSE. Therefore, when n + k + m \u003e= 1, the group H = \u003cg_1, g_2, g_3\u003e admits NO non-trivial block system on Omega.
