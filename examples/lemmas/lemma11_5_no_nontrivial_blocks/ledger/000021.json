SETUP: Since B intersects supp(g_3) non-trivially and g_3(B) is not equal to B, by block definition g_3(B) is disjoint from B. The orbit of B under \u003cg_3\u003e has size r \u003e 1. APPLICATION OF LEMMA 11.4: Since g_3 is a (4+m)-cycle and B intersects supp(g_3) non-trivially, we have: (i) r divides (4+m), and (ii) |B intersect supp(g_3)| = (4+m)/r. CONSTRAINT: We established {2,3,5,6} is contained in B intersect supp(g_3), so |B intersect supp(g_3)| \u003e= 4. Therefore (4+m)/r \u003e= 4, which gives r \u003c= (4+m)/4 = 1 + m/4.","inference":"modus_ponens","dependencies":["1.4"],"workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"8a7b197d486d1801249ea1c7d9cb2df0918e7ee9a3468a70d107b6988c202822","created":"2026-01-18T07:40:59.630317639Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
