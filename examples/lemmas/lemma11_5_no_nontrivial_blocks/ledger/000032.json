The g_1-orbit {B, g_1(B), ..., g_1^{r-1}(B)} partitions supp(g_1) = {1, 3, 4, 6, a_1, ..., a_n}. LOCATING ELEMENTS: Point 1 is in some block g_1^j(B) for some j. Point 4 is in some block g_1^l(B). CONSIDER g_2: supp(g_2) = {1, 2, 4, 5, b_1, ..., b_k}. Points 1 and 4 are both in supp(g_1) intersect supp(g_2). SUB-CASE A: If 1 and 4 are in the SAME g_1-orbit block (say both in g_1^j(B)), then g_1^j(B) contains {1, 4} and intersects supp(g_2) in at least {1, 4}. If g_2 fixes g_1^j(B), then by Lemma 11.2, supp(g_2) is contained in g_1^j(B). This block then contains {1, 2, 4, 5, b_i}. Now apply reasoning from Case 1.","inference":"modus_ponens","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"bf8cd66ad1d902e0c200effdcaf8b43c50319435544a69081dcc833583996b00","created":"2026-01-18T07:42:53.692534279Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
