This is BACKWARDS. From |B intersect supp(g_3)| = (4+m)/r and |B intersect supp(g_3)| \u003e= 4, with r = 2, we get (4+m)/2 \u003e= 4, which gives 4+m \u003e= 8, hence m \u003e= 4 (NOT m \u003c= 4). The inequality direction is wrong. The correct conclusion would be m \u003e= 4, which combined with the constraint r \u003c= 1 + m/4 means we cannot derive m \u003c= 4 from these premises alone.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
