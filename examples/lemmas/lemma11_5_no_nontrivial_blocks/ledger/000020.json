APPLICATION OF LEMMA 11.2: Since g_3(B) = B and B intersects supp(g_3) (specifically {2,3,5,6} is in both), by Lemma 11.2 we conclude supp(g_3) = {2, 3, 5, 6, c_1, ..., c_m} is entirely contained in B. EXPLICIT CONTENTS: B now contains {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, a_1, ..., a_n, b_1, ..., b_k, c_1, ..., c_m} = Omega. CONCLUSION: |B| = N = |Omega|. CONTRADICTION: This contradicts that B is non-trivial (requires |B| \u003c N).","inference":"contradiction","dependencies":["1.4"],"workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"be310d5cc93b5f1444dc281de6cbbac4dfdb112cae6f8fb41b1b444a7892967d","created":"2026-01-18T07:40:52.568691022Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
