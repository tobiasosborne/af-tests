(1) From 1.2, B contains supp(g_1)={1,3,4,6,a_i}. (2) supp(g_2)={1,2,4,5,b_j}. (3) Elements {3,6,a_i} are NOT in supp(g_2). (4) By definition of support, g_2 fixes these elements. (5) If g_2(B)!=B, then g_2(B) disjoint from B (block property). (6) But 3 in B and g_2(3)=3 means 3 in g_2(B). (7) Contradiction: 3 in B cap g_2(B). Every step uses only definitions and previously established facts. Case 1b is IMPOSSIBLE."}
