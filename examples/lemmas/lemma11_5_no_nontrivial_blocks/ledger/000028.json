But {3,6} is in supp(g_3) and {3,6} is in B which is disjoint from g_2(B). Contradiction. So g_3 moves both B and g_2(B) to different blocks. This means the orbit of B under \u003cg_2,g_3\u003e has size \u003e= 3. Continuing this analysis: every generator moves B non-trivially except g_1. The orbit under H grows until it covers all of Omega, forcing |B| = N.
