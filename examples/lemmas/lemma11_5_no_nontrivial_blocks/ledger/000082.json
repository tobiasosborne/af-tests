Specifically: (1) Sub-case A from 1.9.2 (1 and 4 in same block, g_2 fixes block) - claimed to reduce to Case 1, but what if g_2 does NOT fix the block? (2) Sub-case B from 1.9.3 only handles r=2, but the conclusion needs r\u003e=2. (3) 1.9.4 handles r\u003e=3 but has logical gaps. The conclusion claims 'all sub-cases' but does not enumerate them exhaustively.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
