The hypothesis is 'n + k + m \u003e= 1', which only guarantees that at least one of n, k, or m is positive. The statement claims this can be reduced to n \u003e= 1 WLOG, but no symmetry argument is provided. Critically, the three generators g_1, g_2, g_3 do NOT have symmetric roles: supp(g_1) intersect supp(g_2) = {1,4}, supp(g_1) intersect supp(g_3) = {3,6}, supp(g_2) intersect supp(g_3) = {2,5}. These pairwise intersections are different, so there is no obvious symmetry that allows interchanging the roles of n, k, m. A rigorous argument must either: (1) provide an explicit symmetry/isomorphism justifying WLOG, or (2) handle all three cases (n\u003e=1, k\u003e=1, m\u003e=1) separately.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
