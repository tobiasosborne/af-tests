This is a fundamental proof structure error. The proof tree has Case 2 in the wrong location. \n\nEXPECTED STRUCTURE:\n- Case 1: g_1(B) = B (node 1.2)\n  - Case 1a: g_2(B) = B (node 1.3)\n  - Case 1b: g_2(B) != B (node 1.9)\n- Case 2: g_1(B) != B (should be a SIBLING of 1.2, NOT a child of 1.9)\n\nThis misplacement makes it unclear whether Case 2 is actually being analyzed in the proof. The QED (1.8.1) claims Case 2 is covered, but with this incorrect tree structure, the logical flow is broken.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
