How does orbit growth lead to contradiction? The node should conclude with either (a) showing the orbit covers all of Omega forcing |B|=N, or (b) showing block size inconsistencies. The current statement just says 'grows the orbit' without explaining why this is problematic.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
