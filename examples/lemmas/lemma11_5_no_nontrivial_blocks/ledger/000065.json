Element 2 is not in supp(g_1), but this does NOT mean 2 is in a different block. Element 2 could be in block B itself - just in the portion of B that lies outside supp(g_1). A block B may contain elements both inside and outside supp(g_1). The argument needs to track what block contains element 2 more carefully.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
