{"type":"node_created","timestamp":"2026-01-18T07:55:43.162392468Z","node":{"id":"1.9.6","type":"claim","statement":"CASE 1b IMPOSSIBILITY: The assumption g_2(B) != B leads to immediate contradiction. From node 1.2, B contains supp(g_1) = {1, 3, 4, 6, a_1, ..., a_n}. FIXED POINT ANALYSIS: Elements {3, 6, a_1, ..., a_n} are NOT in supp(g_2) = {1, 2, 4, 5, b_j}. Therefore g_2 FIXES these elements: g_2(3) = 3, g_2(6) = 6, g_2(a_i) = a_i. CONTRADICTION: If g_2(B) != B, then g_2(B) is disjoint from B (block property). But 3 is in B (from 1.2), and g_2(3) = 3 means 3 is in g_2(B). Thus 3 is in B cap g_2(B), contradicting disjointness. CONCLUSION: Case 1b is IMPOSSIBLE. Under Case 1, we must have g_2(B) = B, so Case 1 reduces entirely to Case 1a. The child nodes 1.9.1-1.9.5 (originally labeled as Case 2) are superseded by this analysis and the proper Case 2 analysis below.","inference":"contradiction","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"09900b2414e76987f38b5f876cd06cc691d23bd5d1891f591f431dab522d1a7b","created":"2026-01-18T07:55:43.162384288Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
