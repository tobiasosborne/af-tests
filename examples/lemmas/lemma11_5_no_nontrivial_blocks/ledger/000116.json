WLOG JUSTIFICATION: The hypothesis is n + k + m \u003e= 1, so at least one of n, k, m is positive. We argue WLOG that n \u003e= 1. If instead k \u003e= 1 (or m \u003e= 1), we can relabel the generators and elements: rename (g_1, g_2, g_3) -\u003e (g_2, g_1, g_3) [or (g_3, g_1, g_2)] and correspondingly relabel tail elements (a_i, b_j, c_l) -\u003e (b_j, a_i, c_l) [or (c_l, a_i, b_j)] and core elements {1,2,3,4,5,6} appropriately. This relabeling preserves the group structure because: (i) all three generators are cycles of the same form (4+tail)-cycle, (ii) the pairwise intersection pattern |supp(g_i) intersect supp(g_j)| = 2 for i \\!= j is preserved (each pair shares exactly 2 core points), (iii) the tail elements remain disjoint across generators. After relabeling, the generator with positive tail length becomes the 'new g_1' with 'new n \u003e= 1'. Thus WLOG assume n \u003e= 1. Let B be the specific block containing a_1. By definition of block system, for any h in H, either h(B) = B or h(B) is disjoint from B.","owner":"prover-2"}
