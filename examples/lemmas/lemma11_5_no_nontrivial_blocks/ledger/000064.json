The application of Lemma 11.3 explicitly requires 'n \u003e= 1', but this condition is not stated in node 1.2. Without the dependency link to 1.1, the logical structure is incomplete. Additionally, since node 1.1 has been challenged for its WLOG assumption, any node depending on 1.1 inherits that uncertainty. The dependency must be explicitly declared.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
