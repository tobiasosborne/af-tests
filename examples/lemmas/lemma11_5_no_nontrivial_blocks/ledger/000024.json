FROM CASE 1 SETUP (1.2): B contains supp(g_1) = {1, 3, 4, 6, a_1, ..., a_n}. EXPLICIT CONTENTS: B contains {1, 3, 4, 6, a_1, ..., a_n}. ANALYSIS OF g_2: Since g_2(B) is not equal to B, and 1 is in B intersect supp(g_2), by block property g_2(B) is disjoint from B. g_2 = (1 2 4 5 b_1 ... b_k) maps: g_2(1) = 2, g_2(4) = 5. Since 1, 4 are in B, we have 2, 5 are in g_2(B). Also g_2(B) intersect B = empty. EXPLICIT CONTENTS: g_2(B) contains {2, 5} at minimum.","inference":"local_assume","dependencies":["1.2"],"workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"f8ee9e0b97cfd52394c6232498abc5f5ef2afdc60dbd38cba0743d92d4c62b08","created":"2026-01-18T07:41:31.269132347Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
