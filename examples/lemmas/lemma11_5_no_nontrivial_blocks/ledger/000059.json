This is a non-sequitur. The fact that g_3 maps elements between B and g_2(B) tells us: (1) g_3(B) contains g_3(6)=2 and g_3(3)=c_1 (or 5 if m=0). (2) This does NOT imply g_3(B) overlaps with B. Blocks are preserved setwise - g_3(B) is a single block, and the argument has not shown it must overlap both B and g_2(B) simultaneously (which would indeed contradict disjointness of blocks). The argument confuses 'g_3 maps points between two blocks' with 'g_3(B) overlaps both blocks'.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
