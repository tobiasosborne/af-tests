The informal gloss 'tail in block implies support in block' is a reasonable summary but slightly imprecise since Lemma 11.3 specifically concerns g_1 and a_1, not arbitrary 'tails'. Consider using the precise lemma statement or noting that this is a specific instance of the more general Lemma 11.2 applied to g_1.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
