SETUP: Since a_1 is in B and a_1 is in supp(g_1), we have B intersects supp(g_1) non-trivially. By block property, since g_1(B) is not equal to B, we have g_1(B) disjoint from B. The orbit of B under \u003cg_1\u003e has size r \u003e 1 where r divides |supp(g_1)| = 4+n. APPLICATION OF LEMMA 11.4: |B intersect supp(g_1)| = (4+n)/r \u003e= 1 (since a_1 is in B intersect supp(g_1)). The orbit {B, g_1(B), g_1^2(B), ..., g_1^{r-1}(B)} consists of r disjoint blocks that together partition supp(g_1) = {1, 3, 4, 6, a_1, ..., a_n}.","inference":"local_assume","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"bf9062bcae31d53ca6aa9cc9487d82487e6844eaddecea085d50654e1fbcb839","created":"2026-01-18T07:42:42.382643632Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
