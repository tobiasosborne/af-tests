If orbit size r \u003e= 3 under g_1, then |B intersect supp(g_1)| = (4+n)/r \u003c= (4+n)/3. For the partition to work, points {1, 6, 4, 3} are distributed across r blocks. Since g_1 = (1 6 4 3 a_1 ... a_n) cycles through all elements, consecutive elements in the cycle are in consecutive blocks. With r = 3 or more, we need 3 | (4+n). E.g., if n = 2, then 4+2 = 6, r = 3 works: blocks have 2 elements each from supp(g_1). But then consider g_2: it acts on points 1, 4 which may be in different blocks. g_2 maps between blocks, so g_2(block containing 1) overlaps with block containing 2. But 2 is NOT in supp(g_1), so 2 is in a block outside the g_1-orbit! This block intersects supp(g_2), so g_2 action links g_1-orbit blocks with external blocks. This grows the orbit under H.","inference":"modus_ponens","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"a74609338824814e6ae509e80513eedd39b77c3ee25a4d537ad7d1cc4ff0e718","created":"2026-01-18T07:43:17.45612649Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
