{"type":"node_amended","timestamp":"2026-01-18T08:00:05.737257035Z","node_id":"1.9.4","previous_statement":"CASE 2 - Detailed orbit analysis for r \u003e= 3. If orbit size r \u003e= 3 under g_1, then |B intersect supp(g_1)| = (4+n)/r \u003c= (4+n)/3. For the partition to work, points {1, 6, 4, 3} are distributed across r blocks. Since g_1 = (1 6 4 3 a_1 ... a_n) cycles through all elements, consecutive elements in the cycle are in consecutive blocks. With r = 3 or more, we need 3 | (4+n). E.g., if n = 2, then 4+2 = 6, r = 3 works: blocks have 2 elements each from supp(g_1). But then consider g_2: it acts on points 1, 4 which may be in different blocks. g_2 maps between blocks, so g_2(block containing 1) overlaps with block containing 2. But 2 is NOT in supp(g_1), so 2 is in a block outside the g_1-orbit! This block intersects supp(g_2), so g_2 action links g_1-orbit blocks with external blocks. This grows the orbit under H.","new_statement":"CASE 2 - SUPERSEDED BY FIXED-POINT ARGUMENT: This node's detailed orbit analysis for r \u003e= 3 is superseded by the simpler argument in nodes 1.9.1 and 1.9.5. The key insight is: tail elements {a_1, ..., a_n} are NOT in supp(g_2) or supp(g_3), so g_2(a_i) = a_i and g_3(a_i) = a_i for all i. Since a_1 is in B, if g_2(B) \\!= B (disjoint from B), then a_1 would be in both B and g_2(B), contradiction. Therefore g_2(B) = B (and similarly g_3(B) = B) in Case 2. This bypasses the need for orbit analysis under g_1. See node 1.9.5 for the complete Case 2 argument.","owner":"prover-2"}
