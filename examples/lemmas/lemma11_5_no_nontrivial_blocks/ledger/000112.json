This means the exhaustive case split between g_1(B)=B and g_1(B)!=B is not properly represented in the tree structure. (2) Only 7 of 19 nodes are validated (37%). (3) There are 26 open challenges including 9 critical ones on nodes 1.7, 1.8, 1.8.1, 1.9, 1.9.1, 1.9.5, 1.10.2. The proof cannot be accepted until all critical challenges are resolved and the case structure is correctly organized.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
