So B intersect supp(g_3) = {2,3,5,6} exactly, meaning NO c_i are in B. Then all c_1,...,c_4 must be in g_3(B). PARTITION ANALYSIS: Omega = 6 + n + k + 4 = 10 + n + k elements. B contains {1,2,3,4,5,6,a_1,...,a_n,b_1,...,b_k} = 6+n+k elements. g_3(B) contains {c_1,c_2,c_3,c_4} = 4 elements. But |B| + |g_3(B)| = (6+n+k) + 4 = 10+n+k = N. This means {B, g_3(B)} partitions Omega, so there are only 2 blocks. However, B and g_3(B) must have EQUAL size (as blocks in orbit). |B| = 6+n+k but |g_3(B)| = 4. CONTRADICTION unless n = k = 0, but we assumed n \u003e= 1.","inference":"contradiction","dependencies":["1.7"],"workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"70a4945ad0b50367129dd37c544b8501ef32b4d1bf8fd84e8c42d7b11d6c2951","created":"2026-01-18T07:41:19.116684115Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
