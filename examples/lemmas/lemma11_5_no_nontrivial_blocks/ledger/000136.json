SUBCASE m \u003c= 3: If m \u003c= 3, then 1 + m/4 \u003c 2, so r \u003c 2. But r must be a positive integer \u003e 1 (since g_3(B) is not equal to B), so r \u003e= 2. CONTRADICTION for m \u003c= 3. SUBCASE m \u003e= 4: If r = 2, then |B intersect supp(g_3)| = (4+m)/2 \u003e= 4 (verified). The g_3-orbit of B has exactly 2 blocks: {B, g_3(B)}. These partition supp(g_3). CRITICAL OBSERVATION: B contains {1,2,3,4,5,6,a_i,b_j} which has size 6+n+k. Since g_3(B) is disjoint from B and both partition supp(g_3) = {2,3,5,6,c_1,...,c_m}, elements {2,3,5,6} are in B but c_i must be split. However, B already contains 2,3,5,6 so |B intersect supp(g_3)| \u003e= 4 = (4+m)/2 implies m \u003c= 4.","new_statement":"CASE 1a-ii IMMEDIATE CONTRADICTION: We prove Case 1a-ii is impossible via a simpler argument than orbit analysis. SETUP RECALL: In Case 1a-ii, B contains {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, a_1, ..., a_n, b_1, ..., b_k} (from nodes 1.3, 1.4), and g_3(B) != B (assumption of Case 1a-ii). Since g_3(B) != B, by block property g_3(B) is disjoint from B. FIXED POINT ANALYSIS: supp(g_3) = {2, 3, 5, 6, c_1, ..., c_m}. The elements {1, 4, a_1, ..., a_n, b_1, ..., b_k} are NOT in supp(g_3). Therefore g_3 FIXES these elements: g_3(1) = 1, g_3(4) = 4, g_3(a_i) = a_i, g_3(b_j) = b_j for all i, j. CONTRADICTION: Since 1 is in B (from Case 1a setup), and g_3(1) = 1, we have 1 is in g_3(B). Thus 1 is in both B and g_3(B), so B cap g_3(B) contains {1} != empty. This contradicts that g_3(B) is disjoint from B. CONCLUSION: Case 1a-ii (g_1(B) = B, g_2(B) = B, g_3(B) != B) is IMPOSSIBLE.","owner":"prover-2"}
