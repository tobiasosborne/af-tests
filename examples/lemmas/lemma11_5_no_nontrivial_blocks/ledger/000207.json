The fixed-point argument is correctly summarized. The conclusion that 'Case 1 reduces entirely to Case 1a' is logically valid: Case 1 assumes g_1(B)=B, which splits into Case 1a (g_2(B)=B) and Case 1b (g_2(B)\\!=B). Since Case 1b is impossible (by 1.9.6), Case 1 is equivalent to Case 1a. Minor note raised about implicit dependency on 1.9.6."}
