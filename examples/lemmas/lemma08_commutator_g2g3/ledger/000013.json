Using the convention [σ,τ](x) = σ^{-1}(τ^{-1}(σ(τ(x)))) from definition Commutator, we trace each element and identify the cycle decomposition.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"fee6952ac5ba50b1bc1a8d8be608760c2ecc0afa07be427f66e3c51c8370bcd8","created":"2026-01-17T21:14:46.511910238Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
