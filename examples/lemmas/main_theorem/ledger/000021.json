Arithmetic: (-1)^{x+3} = (-1)^x * (-1)^3 = -(-1)^x, so (-1)^{x+3} = +1 iff (-1)^x = -1 iff x is odd. Therefore: generator g_i is even iff its tail length is odd.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"8cc15f02d82c50796ddded0c76a3091b367d8085f04bce6ad8c5aed40a9549d1","created":"2026-01-18T09:10:36.562468982Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
