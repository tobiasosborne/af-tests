Forward: B ∩ supp(σ) ≠ ∅ and σ permutes supp(σ), so σⁱ(B) ∩ supp(σ) ≠ ∅ for all i. Converse: If B' ∩ supp(σ) ≠ ∅, pick x ∈ B' ∩ supp(σ) and y ∈ B ∩ supp(σ). Since σ acts transitively on supp(σ), σⁱ(y) = x for some i. Then x ∈ σⁱ(B) ∩ B', so B' = σⁱ(B) (blocks are disjoint or equal). Thus B' is in the orbit of B.","owner":"prover-2"}
