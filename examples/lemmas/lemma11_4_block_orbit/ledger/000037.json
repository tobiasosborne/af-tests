The direction 'orbit blocks intersect supp(σ)' is clear (if B ∩ supp(σ) ≠ ∅, then σⁱ(B) ∩ supp(σ) ≠ ∅ since σ permutes supp(σ)). However, the converse direction 'every block intersecting supp(σ) is in the orbit of B' requires justification that is not provided. The key argument needed is: if B' ∩ supp(σ) ≠ ∅, pick x ∈ B' ∩ supp(σ) and y ∈ B ∩ supp(σ). Since σ is a cycle, it acts transitively on supp(σ), so ∃i: σⁱ(y) = x. Then x ∈ σⁱ(B) ∩ B', and since blocks are disjoint or equal, B' = σⁱ(B). This reasoning must be made explicit.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
