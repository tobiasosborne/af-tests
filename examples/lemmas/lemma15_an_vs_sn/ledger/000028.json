Node 1.1 is merely a PROOF OVERVIEW, not a substantive result. The G = S_n characterization actually comes from NODE 1.4, which is not referenced. The conclusion should state 'Combining nodes 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4' to correctly cite the sources of the two characterizations (1.3 for G = A_n, 1.4 for G = S_n) and the underlying dichotomy (1.2).","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
