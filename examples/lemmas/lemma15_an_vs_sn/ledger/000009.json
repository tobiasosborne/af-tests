Since [S_n : A_n] = 2, any subgroup G with A_n ≤ G ≤ S_n must be either A_n or S_n. We then characterize which case holds based on the parity of the generators.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"708f563b9056e8c9ca4479c8772e8a0058a548b6cb870294ce09929b44a3bc75","created":"2026-01-18T08:58:58.260338027Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
