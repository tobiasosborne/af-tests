By Lagrange's theorem, any subgroup G with A_n ≤ G ≤ S_n has index [S_n : G] dividing [S_n : A_n] = 2. Thus [S_n : G] ∈ {1, 2}, which means G = S_n or G = A_n.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"8e1aa5224a10e025dbbd602123188c1684229b1439d032904ac485b5b176eeb0","created":"2026-01-18T08:59:02.841483693Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
