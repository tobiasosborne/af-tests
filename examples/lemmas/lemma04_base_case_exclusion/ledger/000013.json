The alternating group has index 2 in the symmetric group, so:\n|A_6| = |S_6|/2 = 720/2 = 360.\n\nTherefore, |A_6| = 360 and |S_6| = 720.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"e12c314693996f604688b2c2c5ecdc7e29177144bceab40f9dcdf201ffdbc418","created":"2026-01-17T20:12:21.650868606Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
