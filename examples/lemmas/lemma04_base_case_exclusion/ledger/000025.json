While this is a fundamental result in group theory (isomorphisms are bijective homomorphisms, hence preserve cardinality), a maximally rigorous proof would add this as an assumption or cite it from a standard reference. This is noted for completeness but does not affect the validity of the proof.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
