While this is a standard result in group theory (A_n = ker(sgn) where sgn: S_n -\u003e {+/-1} is surjective, so [S_n:A_n] = 2), and the A_6 definition already includes |A_6| = 6\\!/2 = 360 which makes this claim redundant, a pedantic proof would either cite this as a known theorem or prove it from the definition of even permutations.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
