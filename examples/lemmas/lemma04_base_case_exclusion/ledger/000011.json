The proof proceeds in three parts:\n\nPart 1: By Lemma 3 (Base Case Structure), H_6 ≅ S_4, hence |H_6| = |S_4| = 4! = 24.\n\nPart 2: We compute |A_6| = 6!/2 = 720/2 = 360 and |S_6| = 6! = 720.\n\nPart 3: Since |H_6| = 24 \u003c 360 = |A_6| \u003c 720 = |S_6|, and unequal cardinalities imply distinct groups (by Subgroup_Cardinality), we conclude H_6 ∉ {A_6, S_6}.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"9621848328dd00985de3335506c84778200c2ae0f0a95b3ae17325b7c7a427fb","created":"2026-01-17T20:12:11.509078567Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
