The statement uses this principle to conclude H_6 ≠ A_6 and H_6 ≠ S_6, but does not establish that H_6 ≤ A_6 or H_6 ≤ S_6. While the conclusion is mathematically correct (distinct cardinalities imply distinct sets), the appeal to Subgroup_Cardinality may be imprecise. The more general principle being used is simply that sets with different cardinalities cannot be equal - this does not require a subgroup relationship.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
