(2) A_6 definition correctly gives |A_6| = 6!/2 = 360. (3) Factorial calculation 6! = 720 is correct. (4) Division 720/2 = 360 is correct. Two minor/note-level issues raised: (a) Definitions S_6, A_6, Factorial should be explicitly listed as dependencies for traceability. (b) The claim that alternating group has index 2 is asserted without proof, though this is standard and the A_6 definition already includes the cardinality formula. The mathematics is sound."}
