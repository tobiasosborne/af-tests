Using the convention [σ,τ](x) = σ^{-1}(τ^{-1}(σ(τ(x)))) from definition Commutator, we trace each element and identify the cycle decomposition.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"aa26464023712519a8f7545477fea6f8500ef13ccea7a25dcd6938e57402ab7b","created":"2026-01-17T21:10:03.788385148Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
