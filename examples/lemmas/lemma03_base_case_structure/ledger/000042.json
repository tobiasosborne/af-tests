However, these generators are 4-cycles, whereas node 1 states the original generators are h₁, h₂, h₃. The relationship between these generator sets is not explained. Are these the same generators in cycle notation? If so, this should be explicit. If not, the claim that this GAP group equals H_6 needs justification.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
