The statement claims 'The isomorphism H_6 ≅ S_4 is realized via the action on the 6 edges of a tetrahedron, where the 3 pairs of opposite edges correspond to the blocks of B₀.' This is a geometric claim requiring proof: (1) that S_4 acts on 6 edges of a tetrahedron, (2) that opposite edges pair into 3 blocks, and (3) that this action matches the block structure B₀. Either prove this claim or add it as an external reference.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
