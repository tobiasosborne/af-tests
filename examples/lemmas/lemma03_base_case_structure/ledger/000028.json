The wreath product S_3 ≀ Z_2 (with Z_2 acting on 2 points) has order |S_3|^2 × |Z_2| = 36 × 2 = 72. If the intended wreath product is Z_2 ≀ S_3 (with S_3 acting on 3 points), the order is |Z_2|^3 × |S_3| = 8 × 6 = 48. Neither equals 24. The calculation '6 × 4 = 24' conflates the semi-direct product structure from node 1.5 with wreath product order - a category error.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
