The claim that 'S_4 acting on 6 edges of a tetrahedron where 3 pairs of opposite edges form 3 blocks' matches H_6's structure requires verification: (1) The tetrahedron has 4 vertices and 6 edges, but 'opposite edges' needs clarification - in a tetrahedron, any two non-adjacent edges are opposite. (2) The claim that this action is isomorphic to H_6's action on {1,...,6} with blocks B₀ needs explicit verification of the block-preserving property. (3) No proof is given that this action is faithful or has the same kernel structure.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
