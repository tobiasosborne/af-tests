Even if the wreath product order were correct, this would only show |H_6| ≤ |S_3 ≀ Z_2|, not that H_6 ≅ S_4. An embedding into a larger group does not establish isomorphism with a different group. The logical connection between the embedding claim and the S_4 isomorphism is not justified.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
