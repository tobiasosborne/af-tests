Alternative geometric verification: H_6 embeds in S_3 ≀ Z_2 (wreath product), which has order 6 × 4 = 24. The structure is the same as S_4 acting on the 6 edges of a tetrahedron, where the 3 pairs of opposite edges form 3 blocks. Each element of S_4 permutes the 4 vertices, inducing a permutation of the 6 edges that preserves the pairing of opposite edges. Computational verification (GAP): H_6 = ⟨(1 6 4 3), (1 2 4 5), (5 6 2 3)⟩ ≅ S_4. The group is self-dual with H_6 acting imprimitively on {1,...,6} via the block structure B₀.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"66ec1503b1bd4339ccaa6513f0b09dbca4994eed6b7199e5d47c171c2ab8769e","created":"2026-01-17T19:57:09.742111538Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
