Each block has 2 elements, so ker(φ) ≤ Sym({1,4}) × Sym({2,5}) × Sym({3,6}) ≅ (Z_2)³. Key observation: h₁² = (1 4)(3 6), h₂² = (1 4)(2 5), h₃² = (2 5)(3 6) are in ker(φ). These generate a subgroup {id, (1 4)(2 5), (1 4)(3 6), (2 5)(3 6)} of order 4. The kernel ker(φ) has exactly order 4: it contains products of even numbers of block transpositions, forming the Klein 4-group V_4 ≅ Z_2 × Z_2.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"e13536fe84115863845fac917f2d1c7653bcd3a5d98e2b5a8f954f792aa10190","created":"2026-01-17T19:56:58.113192012Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
