The map φ sends each element g ∈ H_6 to the permutation of blocks induced by g's action on the block labels.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"9337eb60d21a208cc72d2d594e369865b29218b381a6799013a5d2d1affb9065","created":"2026-01-17T19:56:51.560223558Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
