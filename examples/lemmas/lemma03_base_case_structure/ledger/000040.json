At minimum, the node should declare a dependency on whatever node or external eventually establishes the partition preservation property (once Lemma 1 is properly defined). Additionally, the node should ideally have 'Imprimitive_Action' in its scope for full traceability.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
