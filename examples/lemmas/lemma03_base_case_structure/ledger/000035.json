The statement claims 'By Lemma 2, the induced homomorphism φ: H_6 → Sym(B₀) is surjective with Im(φ) = S_3' but no Lemma 2 exists in the proof system. Either define Lemma 2 as an external reference, extract it from a validated node, or replace the reference with explicit reasoning.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
