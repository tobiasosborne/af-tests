By Lemma 1, H_6 preserves B₀ = {{1,4}, {2,5}, {3,6}}, hence acts imprimitively. By Lemma 2, the induced homomorphism φ: H_6 → Sym(B₀) is surjective with Im(φ) = S_3. The kernel ker(φ) consists of permutations fixing each block setwise, forming a Klein 4-group V_4 of order 4. By the first isomorphism theorem, |H_6| = |S_3| × |V_4| = 6 × 4 = 24 = |S_4|. The isomorphism H_6 ≅ S_4 is realized via the action on the 6 edges of a tetrahedron, where the 3 pairs of opposite edges correspond to the blocks of B₀.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"ef2c419bcef8069b22bac4b98481091287e7d69b623a805372ec8fa1349f6f4e","created":"2026-01-17T19:56:36.980941683Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
