There are no external references, no extracted lemmas, and no assumptions establishing what 'Lemma 2' is. This is an unverified external dependency. Either: (1) add Lemma 2 as an external reference with proper citation, (2) prove the surjectivity claim directly within the proof, or (3) extract it as a prior validated lemma. Currently, the justification relies on an undefined reference.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
