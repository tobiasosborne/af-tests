However, order equality is necessary but NOT sufficient for group isomorphism. For example, Z_4 and Z_2 × Z_2 both have order 4 but are not isomorphic. A proper isomorphism proof requires either: (1) constructing an explicit bijective homomorphism, (2) showing both groups satisfy a unique characterization up to isomorphism, or (3) verifying structural properties (e.g., both groups have the same number of elements of each order, same normal subgroup structure, etc.).","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
