There is no external reference, assumption, lemma entry, or sub-node that establishes what 'Lemma 1' states or proves it. The claim that 'By Lemma 1, the partition B₀ is preserved setwise by each generator h₁, h₂, h₃' relies on an undefined reference. Either: (1) Lemma 1 should be added as an external reference with verification, (2) the proof of the preservation property should be included as a sub-node, or (3) the statement should be modified to prove the preservation directly rather than citing an undefined lemma. Note: I have verified the mathematical claim is actually true (each generator does preserve B₀ setwise), but the citation to a non-existent 'Lemma 1' is a formal defect in the proof structure.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
