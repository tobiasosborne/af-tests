## Completed This Session

### Infrastructure for primitive_peirce_one_scalar (H-O 2.9.4(ii))

Added 4 theorems to `AfTests/Jordan/Primitive.lean`:

| Theorem | Lines | What it does |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| `finite_dim_field_over_real` | 79-83 | Frobenius: fin-dim field over ℝ is ℝ or ℂ (mathlib) |
| `complex_not_formally_real` | 86-91 | ℂ not formally real: i² + 1² = 0 |
| `formallyReal_field_is_real` | 96-119 | Formally real fin-dim field = ℝ |
| `artinian_reduced_is_product_of_fields` | 125-128 | H-O 2.9.3 (mathlib) |
| `artinian_reduced_factor_field` | 131-133 | Each factor is a field |

### Issues Closed
- **af-agxd**: Fields over ℝ are ℝ or ℂ (H-O 2.2.6)
- **af-pdie**: Formally real field is ℝ
- **af-tceg**: Artinian ring decomposition (H-O 2.9.3)

REMAINING FOR primitive_peirce_one_scalar:
├── af-vv7z: H-O 2.5.5 (power-associative subalgebra) [50-80 LOC]
└── af-8zmu: Assembly [30-40 LOC]
    └── af-sgff: FILL primitive_peirce_one_scalar
```

## Next Session Recommendations

### Priority: af-vv7z (H-O 2.5.5)

**What's needed:** Show that for a ∈ {pAp}, the subalgebra generated by {a, p} is associative.

**Key insight:** This is essentially power-associativity. We already have:
- `L_L_jsq_comm`: T_a and T_{a²} commute
- `fundamental_jordan`: (a² ∘ b) ∘ a = a² ∘ (b ∘ a)

**Approach options:**

1. **Dimensional argument** (simpler, ~30 LOC):
   - If dim({pAp}) > 1, take x linearly independent from p
   - span{p, x} with Jordan product is 2-dim commutative algebra
   - Must be ℝ² or ℂ (both contradict primitivity/formal reality)

2. **Full power-associativity** (complete, ~60 LOC):
   - Prove `jpow_add`: jpow a m * jpow a n = jpow a (m+n)
   - Use operator formula from LinearizedJordan.lean
   - Build ring structure on ℝ[a]

**Recommendation:** Try dimensional argument first - it avoids constructing explicit ring structure.

## Files Modified This Session

- `AfTests/Jordan/Primitive.lean` — Added 5 theorems (~50 LOC)
- `HANDOFF.md` — This file

## Key Learnings

1. **Mathlib coverage is excellent:**
   - `Real.nonempty_algEquiv_or` for Frobenius theorem
   - `IsArtinianRing.equivPi` for H-O 2.9.3

2. **Infrastructure first:** Building the foundation (field classification, ring decomposition) before tackling the main theorem makes the assembly cleaner.
