## Completed This Session

### Part 1: Critical Discovery (earlier)

**The ring structure approach for PeirceSpace e 1 is INVALID.**

PeirceSpace e 1 is NOT associative for general idempotents!

**Counterexample:** For e = diag(1,1,0) in H₃(ℝ):
- PeirceSpace e 1 ≅ H₂(ℝ) (2×2 symmetric matrices)
- H₂(ℝ) is NOT associative under Jordan product

Closed 7 issues as WONTFIX (af-1tzf, af-elpg, af-gwqf, af-t68m, af-nl8m, af-5669, af-2oyk).

### Part 2: Critical Review of af-8zmu Strategy

**Verified against H-O book directly:**

1. **H-O 2.5.5 (lines 1445-1467):** For a ∈ U_p(A), T_p(a) = U_p(a) = a implies the algebra generated by {a, p} is ASSOCIATIVE. ✓

2. **H-O 2.9.4(ii) (lines 2231-2232):** Explicitly uses 2.9.3 to decompose. ✓

3. **The strategy is mathematically correct.**

**However, LOC estimate was wrong:**
- Original: 40-60 LOC
- Actual: **160-250 LOC** of infrastructure needed

### New Issues Created

| Issue | Description | LOC |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| af-vv7z | H-O 2.5.5: Operator commutation → associative subalgebra | 50-80 |
| af-tceg | H-O 2.9.3: Artinian ring without nilpotents = product of fields | 50-80 |

(af-agxd and af-pdie already existed)

## Next Session Recommendations

**Priority order for unblocking primitive_peirce_one_scalar:**

1. **af-agxd** (P1): Fields over ℝ are ℝ or ℂ
   - Check mathlib for Frobenius theorem
   - ~20 LOC if in mathlib

2. **af-pdie** (P1): Formally real field = ℝ
   - Depends on af-agxd
   - Show ℂ is not formally real (i² + 1² = 0)
   - ~20 LOC

3. **af-vv7z** (P1): H-O 2.5.5
   - Define "subalgebra generated by elements"
   - Use power-associativity
   - ~50-80 LOC

4. **af-tceg** (P1): H-O 2.9.3
   - Connect to mathlib's Wedderburn-Artin or prove directly
   - ~50-80 LOC

5. **af-8zmu** (P1): Assembly
   - Combine the above
   - ~30-40 LOC

## Lesson Learned

**Always verify mathematical claims against the original source before implementing.**

Session 74/75 wasted effort on a ring structure that doesn't exist. Session 76
corrected this by reading H-O 2.5.5 and 2.9.4 directly and creating properly
scoped sub-issues with realistic LOC estimates.
