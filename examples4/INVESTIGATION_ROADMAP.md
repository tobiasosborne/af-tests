## Model Summary

**Degrees of freedom.** N = 2j+1 complex fermions psi_m in the spin-j representation
of SU(2), where j is an odd integer. The canonical anticommutation relations are
{psi_m, psi^dag_{m'}} = delta_{m,m'}.

**Supercharge.**

    Q = (1/3!) sqrt(2 J N) sum_{m1,m2,m3} C^j_{m1 m2 m3} psi_{m1} psi_{m2} psi_{m3}

where C^j_{m1 m2 m3} is the SU(2) 3j symbol (Wigner 3j symbol) with all three angular
momenta equal to j, and J (sans-serif) is a coupling constant with dimensions of energy.
For odd j, C^j is antisymmetric under exchange of indices, matching the fermionic
antisymmetry.

**Hamiltonian.**

    H = {Q, Q^dag} >= 0

This is manifestly non-negative. BPS states satisfy H|psi> = 0, equivalently Q|psi> = Q^dag|psi> = 0.

**Normal-ordered form.**

    H = (J/3) [ (2j+1) - 3(N_psi + j + 1/2) + 3 sum_m O^dag_{j,m} O_{j,m} ]

where O_{l,m} = sqrt(2(2l+1)) sum_{m1<m2} (j j l; m1 m2 -m) psi_{m1} psi_{m2},
and N_psi = sum_m psi^dag_m psi_m - (2j+1)/2 is the shifted fermion number.

**Symmetries.**
- SU(2): generated by J_3 = sum_m m psi^dag_m psi_m, J_+, J_-
- U(1)_R: R = N_psi / 3
- Charge conjugation: psi_m -> (-1)^m psi^dag_{-m}, sending N_psi -> -N_psi

**Hilbert space.** Dimension 2^{2j+1}. Grows by factor 16 with each step in j (j odd).

**Key scales.**
- Maximum SU(2) spin: l_max = j(j+1)/2
- Maximum R-charge: R_max = (2j+1)/6
- BPS states at R = +/- 1/6: approximately 3^j states
- Phase transition at R_c = (sqrt(2)-1)N/3 (Heydeman et al.)

## I. Numerical Investigation

### I.A. Exact Diagonalization

The paper performs exact diagonalization (ED) up to j=11. At j=11 the full Hilbert
space has dimension 2^23 = 8,388,608, but exploiting SU(2) x U(1)_R symmetry reduces
the problem to sectors of fixed (N_psi, J_3). The largest block (R=+/-1/6, J_3=0) has
dimension 32,540.

**Strategy to push beyond j=11.**

1. **Block structure.** Work exclusively in the (N_psi, J_3=0) sector. Since all SU(2)
   multiplets have integer spin, each multiplet contains a J_3=0 state. This is sufficient
   to recover the full spectrum. Charge conjugation symmetry means only N_psi < 0 sectors
   need to be computed.

2. **j=13 estimates.** At j=13, N=27, the full Hilbert space is 2^27 ~ 1.34 x 10^8.
   The (R=1/6, J_3=0) sector dimension can be estimated from the partition function
   counting: d_0 for the J_3=0 sector is approximately 2^N / (sigma sqrt(2pi)) with
   sigma = sqrt(j^3/6). For j=13, sigma ~ 23.9, giving d_0 ~ 2.24 x 10^6 for the full
   J_3=0 sector. Within this, the R=1/6 fixed-charge block should be of order ~200,000
   states. This is within reach of sparse matrix methods (Lanczos/Arnoldi) but
   challenging for full diagonalization.

3. **Implementation approach.**
   - Enumerate Fock states: all sequences of n integers m_i with -j <= m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_n <= j
     and sum(m_i) = 0. This gives a basis for the (N_psi, J_3=0) sector.
   - Compute matrix elements of H (normal-ordered form) and J^2 (normal-ordered Casimir)
     between these Fock states. The normal ordering means: read off coefficients and track
     Fermi signs.
   - To resolve accidental degeneracies: first diagonalize a generic linear combination
     aH + bJ^2, then compute eigenvalues of H and J^2 on the resulting eigenvectors.

4. **Computational framework.** The paper notes that the Jordan-Wigner approach is
   NOT ideal here because the interaction has O(N^2) terms (not O(N^3) as in SYK).
   The normal-ordered method avoids the need to construct large fermion operator matrices.
   Recommended: implement in Julia (sparse matrices, Arpack), Python (scipy.sparse),
   or C++ (Eigen/SLEPc). For j=13, consider distributed-memory approaches (PETSc/SLEPc).

5. **Sparse matrix structure.** The normal-ordered Hamiltonian is quartic in fermions.
   Each term in sum_m O^dag_{j,m} O_{j,m} involves two creation and two annihilation
   operators. The sparsity pattern is determined by the 3j symbol selection rules
   (m1 + m2 + m3 = 0 and triangle inequality, both trivially satisfied when all spins
   are j). For j=13, the Hamiltonian matrix has O(N^2) = O(700) non-zero terms per row.

**What to compute.**

- Full energy spectrum E(R, l) for each (R-charge, spin) sector
- BPS state count: verify the ~3^j scaling at R=+/-1/6
- Sporadic BPS states: the paper finds sporadic BPS multiplets at |R|=1/2 (j=7,9 but
  not j=3,5,11) and |R|=5/6 (j=9 only). Check whether these persist at j=13.
- Energy gaps: compare with Schwarzian prediction E_gap = J / (8 N alpha_S) (|R| - 1/2)^2
  where alpha_S ~ 0.00842
- Spectral form factor (SFF): extend the SFF analysis (currently done for j=11,
  R=1/6, l=16 with 1078 non-BPS multiplets) to j=13
- Level spacing statistics: GOE vs GUE vs Poisson in each symmetry sector
- Maximum-spin states: verify the nonlinear energy trajectory for l = l_max^{(R)}

**Comparison targets.**

- Schwarzian predictions for energy gaps (valid for small R, small l)
- CFT_2 predictions at large SU(2) charge (valid for l ~ l_max)
- Linear trajectory at large |R| >= j/6
- Sporadic BPS pattern: does it persist or is it a finite-j artifact?


### I.B. Thermal Properties

All computations here are in the Hamiltonian framework via the spectrum.

1. **Partition function.** Z(beta) = Tr[exp(-beta H)] computed from the exact spectrum.
   Can be refined to Z(beta, mu_R, theta) = Tr[exp(-beta H + mu_R R + i theta J_3)].

2. **Thermodynamic quantities.**
   - Energy: <E>(beta) = -d/d(beta) ln Z
   - Entropy: S(beta) = beta <E> + ln Z
   - Specific heat: C(beta) = -beta^2 d^2/d(beta)^2 ln Z
   - R-charge susceptibility: chi_R = d<R>/d(mu_R)

3. **Phase transition.** Heydeman et al. predict a phase transition at R_c = (sqrt(2)-1)N/3.
   At this transition the approximately conformal low-energy regime is lost. Study:
   - Microcanonical entropy S(E, R) as a function of energy and R-charge
   - Look for non-analytic behavior in the canonical ensemble near beta_c
   - Density of states rho(E) and its moments in each (R, l) sector

4. **Chemical potentials.** Study the grand canonical ensemble with chemical potentials
   for both R-charge and SU(2). The paper notes that "it should be possible to extend
   the melonic (or dynamical mean field theory) treatment to the regime with a relatively
   small chemical potential for the SU(2) symmetry." Numerical investigation can
   validate or inform this.


### I.C. Correlation Functions

1. **Two-point functions.** In the Hamiltonian framework:

       G(t) = (1/N) sum_m <psi^dag_m(t) psi_m(0)>_beta

   where psi_m(t) = exp(iHt) psi_m exp(-iHt). At zero temperature, evaluate in the
   ground state(s). At finite temperature, use the thermal density matrix.

   Compute via spectral decomposition:

       G(t) = (1/N) sum_{m,a,b} |<a|psi_m|b>|^2 exp(i(E_a - E_b)t - beta E_a) / Z

   where |a>, |b> are energy eigenstates. This requires the matrix elements of psi_m
   between eigenstates.

2. **Conformal comparison.** In the melonic large-j limit, the two-point function
   should approach the conformal ansatz G(t) ~ |t|^{-2 Delta} with Delta_psi = 1/6.
   Measure the effective exponent at finite j by fitting G(t) in appropriate time windows.

3. **Out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs).** The diagnostic for quantum chaos:

       F(t) = <psi^dag_m(t) psi_n(0) psi^dag_m(t) psi_n(0)>_beta

   In a chaotic system, F(t) ~ 1 - epsilon exp(lambda_L t) at early times, where lambda_L
   is the Lyapunov exponent. The Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound gives lambda_L <= 2pi/beta.
   N=2 SYK saturates this bound; since the melonic limit is identical, we expect the same here.

   Compute via exact diagonalization at finite j and extrapolate lambda_L(j) to large j.

4. **Spectral form factor (continued).** The SFF is already studied in the paper for
   one sector. Extend to multiple (R, l) sectors to map out the chaotic vs integrable
   regions of the spectrum. The paper notes difficulty in classifying the level statistics
   as GOE or GUE; with j=13 there will be more states available.

## II. Tensor Network Methods

### II.A. Ground State via DMRG/MPS

**The challenge.** The natural Hilbert space is that of N = 2j+1 complex fermionic modes.
A complex fermion has 4 states (|0>, psi^dag|0>, psi_bar^dag|0>, psi^dag psi_bar^dag|0>),
but in this model we have a single complex fermion per site, so each site has 2 states
(occupied or empty). The total Hilbert space dimension is 2^N.

**Jordan-Wigner mapping.** The standard approach maps the fermionic system to a
spin-1/2 chain of length N = 2j+1. The fermion operators become:

    psi^dag_m = (prod_{k<m} sigma^z_k) sigma^+_m
    psi_m     = (prod_{k<m} sigma^z_k) sigma^-_m

However, the paper explicitly warns that Jordan-Wigner is NOT ideal here because
the interaction has O(N^2) terms (each O^dag_{j,m} O_{j,m} involves sums over m1, m2
with 3j symbol selection rules), rather than the O(N^3) terms of SYK. The trade-off
is that the J-W construction involves multiplying large matrices to construct the
Hamiltonian, and one cannot straightforwardly fix the fermion number.

**Alternative: Fermionic tensor networks (fTN).** These natively respect
anti-commutation relations without the overhead of Jordan-Wigner strings.

- Bultinck, Williamson, Haegeman, Verstraete, PRB 95, 075108 (2017)

**Incorporating SU(2) symmetry.** The SU(2) global symmetry can be exploited by using
symmetric tensor networks. The irrep labels serve as quantum numbers that block-diagonalize
the tensor contractions, significantly reducing computational cost.

- Weichselbaum, Ann. Phys. 327, 2972 (2012): non-abelian symmetries in tensor networks

**Practical considerations.**
- The Hamiltonian has long-range interactions (the 3j symbols couple all pairs of sites).
  This means the MPO bond dimension will be large.
- DMRG convergence may be slow for highly entangled ground states, which we expect in
  the chaotic regime.
- For BPS states (E=0), DMRG can target the ground state directly since H >= 0.


### II.B. Matrix Product Operator (MPO) for H

The Hamiltonian in normal-ordered form has structure:

    H = (J/3) [ (2j+1) - 3(N_psi + j + 1/2) + 3 sum_m O^dag_{j,m} O_{j,m} ]

The free part (N_psi) is diagonal in the occupation basis: sum_m n_m - (2j+1)/2.
The interacting part involves quartic terms.

**Quartic interaction structure.** Each O^dag_{j,m} O_{j,m} expands to:

    sum_{m1<m2, m3<m4} 2(2j+1) (j j j; m1 m2 -m)(j j j; m3 m4 -m) psi^dag_{m1} psi^dag_{m2} psi_{m4} psi_{m3}

The 3j symbol selection rule m1 + m2 = m requires m1 + m2 = m3 + m4 (after summing over m).
This provides sparsity: not all quartic terms are present.

**MPO construction.**
- Write H as a sum of terms, each a product of local operators.
- The number of terms is O(N^2) (as noted in the paper), specifically O(N^2) distinct
  pairs (m1, m2) contributing to O_{j,m}.
- The MPO bond dimension D_MPO will be of order O(N^2) in the worst case.
  However, 3j symbol selection rules and the specific structure of the normal-ordered
  form may allow for compression.
- For j=3 (N=7), D_MPO is manageable. For j=11 (N=23), D_MPO ~ 500+ may be challenging.

**Bond dimension estimates for MPS.**
- BPS states may have relatively low entanglement (they are special zero-energy states),
  suggesting modest bond dimension chi ~ 50-200 for j <= 11.
- Excited states in the chaotic regime will have volume-law entanglement, making MPS
  representation inefficient. However, low-lying excited states may still be tractable.
- The entanglement entropy S_ent of a BPS state across a cut dividing the first k sites
  from the rest is bounded by min(k, N-k) log 2, but the actual entanglement structure
  depends on the specific state.


### II.C. Time Evolution (TEBD/tDMRG)

1. **Real-time dynamics.** Use time-dependent DMRG (tDMRG) or time-evolving block
   decimation (TEBD) to study:
   - Quantum quenches: prepare a simple product state, evolve under H, measure
     local observables and entanglement growth
   - Thermalization: the model is expected to be chaotic (it is equivalent to N=2 SYK
     in the melonic limit), so local observables should thermalize
   - Entanglement growth: in chaotic systems, entanglement entropy grows linearly until
     saturation. The growth rate is related to the butterfly velocity.

2. **Technical challenges.**
   - Long-range interactions make TEBD less efficient (TEBD is designed for
     nearest-neighbor interactions; the long-range version requires MPO exponentiation).
   - tDMRG with the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) may be more suitable.
   - The entanglement growth limits the accessible time: for chaotic systems, the bond
     dimension needed grows exponentially with time.
   - Realistic targets: t ~ O(1/J) evolution for j <= 11.

3. **Observables to track.**
   - Local occupation numbers <n_m>(t)
   - Two-point correlator G(t) = (1/N) sum_m <psi^dag_m(t) psi_m(0)>
   - Entanglement entropy S(t) across the equator (m=0 cut)
   - OTOC via purification or Keldysh contour methods


### II.D. Thermal States via METTS/Purification

1. **Minimally Entangled Typical Thermal States (METTS).** The METTS algorithm samples
   thermal states by iterating:
   - Evolve a product state in imaginary time: |psi> = exp(-beta H/2) |s>
   - Measure in a product basis to collapse to a new |s'>
   - Repeat, collecting samples

   This avoids the need for full diagonalization and can access larger j than ED.

2. **Purification.** Represent the thermal density matrix rho = exp(-beta H) / Z as a
   pure state in a doubled Hilbert space: |Psi(beta)> = exp(-beta H/2) |I> where |I>
   is a maximally entangled state. Then thermal expectation values become pure-state
   expectations in the doubled system.

3. **Target applications.**
   - Finite-temperature partition function Z(beta) for j=13, 15 (beyond ED reach)
   - Thermal entropy and specific heat
   - Thermal correlators at intermediate j
   - Chemical potential dependence: include exp(mu_R R) in the imaginary-time evolution


### II.E. Density Matrix Renormalization for BPS Sector

1. **BPS state targeting.** Since H >= 0, BPS states are exact ground states.
   Standard DMRG finds the ground state. To find multiple BPS states, use:
   - Projection to specific (R, l) sectors via quantum number conservation
   - Excited-state DMRG with penalty method: H_eff = H + lambda sum_i |psi_i><psi_i|
     where |psi_i> are previously found states
   - Subspace expansion methods

2. **BPS state structure.** In the CFT_2 regime (large SU(2) charge), BPS states
   have a known structure: they are generated by the phi_+/- boson oscillators acting
   on the maximal-J_3 state. The BPS partition function is:

       Z_BPS = 2 prod_{k=0}^infty 1 / ((1 - q^{1+3k})(1 - q^{2+3k}))

   DMRG can verify this structure and explore the BPS states outside the CFT_2 regime
   (at lower J_3 where the CFT description breaks down).

3. **Comparison with CFT_2 predictions.**
   - Entanglement structure of BPS states: is it consistent with the factorized Hilbert
     space H = H^z tensor H^{+/-}?
   - BPS state counting at intermediate J_3 values
   - Overlap of DMRG-found BPS states with the CFT_2 ansatz states

## III. Mean Field Theory with Grassmann Numbers (Hepp-Lieb-Werner Approach)

This is the most mathematically sophisticated direction. It provides a systematic
framework for understanding the large-j limit as a classical limit.


### III.A. Background: Hepp-Lieb-Werner Mean Field Theory

**Historical context.** Hepp and Lieb (1973) established the rigorous mathematical
framework for mean field limits in quantum mechanics. Their key insight: for suitable
quantum systems with N degrees of freedom, the dynamics converges to classical
(Hamiltonian) dynamics as N -> infinity, with quantum corrections suppressed by 1/N.

Key references:
- K. Hepp, E.H. Lieb, "On the superradiant phase transition for molecules in a
  quantized radiation field: the Dicke maser model," Ann. Phys. 76, 360 (1973)
- K. Hepp, E.H. Lieb, "Phase transitions in reservoir-driven open systems with
  applications to lasers and superconductors," Helv. Phys. Acta 46, 573 (1973)

**The bosonic paradigm.** For bosonic systems, the procedure is:
1. Replace quantum operators a, a^dag by classical variables z, z* (coherent states)
2. The quantum Hamiltonian H becomes a classical Hamiltonian h(z, z*)
3. The quantum evolution converges to the classical Hamiltonian flow
4. Corrections are O(1/N) and can be computed systematically (Bogoliubov theory)

**Werner's extension to fermions.** R.F. Werner extended the Hepp-Lieb framework to
fermionic systems using Grassmann-valued coherent states. The key difference: the
"classical limit" involves Grassmann numbers rather than complex numbers, so the
classical phase space is a supermanifold.

Key references:
- R.F. Werner, "Large deviations and mean-field quantum systems," Quantum Probability
  and Related Topics VII, World Scientific (1992)
- For general fermionic mean field: V. Bach, E.H. Lieb, J.P. Solovej, "Generalized
  Hartree-Fock theory and the Hubbard model," J. Stat. Phys. 76, 3 (1994)

**Relation to large-N.** In the present model, N = 2j+1 plays the role of the number
of degrees of freedom. The large-j limit is the mean field limit. The melonic
Schwinger-Dyson equations of the paper are precisely the mean field (self-consistency)
equations.


### III.B. Fermionic Coherent States

**Definition.** For complex fermions psi_m (m = -j, ..., j), the fermionic coherent
state is:

    |eta> = exp(sum_m eta_m psi^dag_m) |0>

where eta_m are Grassmann numbers satisfying eta_m eta_{m'} = -eta_{m'} eta_m
and eta_m^2 = 0.

**Properties.**
- Annihilation: psi_m |eta> = eta_m |eta>
- Overlap: <eta|eta'> = exp(sum_m eta*_m eta'_m)
- Resolution of identity: integral d(eta*) d(eta) exp(-sum_m eta*_m eta_m) |eta><eta| = 1
  (with Berezin integration convention)
- Expectation values: <eta| psi^dag_m psi_n |eta> / <eta|eta> = eta*_m eta_n

**Explicit expansion.** The coherent state expands as:

    |eta> = |0> + sum_m eta_m psi^dag_m |0> + sum_{m1<m2} eta_{m1} eta_{m2} psi^dag_{m1} psi^dag_{m2} |0> + ...

Each term involves a specific Fock state weighted by a Grassmann monomial.

**Why Grassmann and not complex?** For bosons, coherent states are parameterized by
complex numbers, and the "classical limit" gives ordinary classical mechanics. For
fermions, the anti-commutation relations force Grassmann parameters. The resulting
"classical" dynamics is on a Grassmann supermanifold. However, for many purposes
(especially expectation values of even observables), one can extract real-valued
quantities by performing the Grassmann integrals.


### III.C. Mean Field Equations for This Model

**Classical Hamiltonian.** The expectation value of H in a Grassmann coherent state gives
the "classical Hamiltonian" h(eta*, eta):

    h(eta*, eta) = <eta|H|eta> / <eta|eta>

For H = {Q, Q^dag}, this involves:
- Q contains cubic terms in psi with 3j symbol coefficients
- Q^dag contains cubic terms in psi^dag
- The anticommutator {Q, Q^dag} has terms from psi^dag psi (bilinear, the free part)
  and psi^dag psi^dag psi psi (quartic, the interaction)

Explicitly:

    h(eta*, eta) = (J/3) [ (2j+1) - 3(n_psi + j + 1/2)
                   + 3 sum_m |O_{j,m}(eta)|^2 ]

where n_psi = sum_m eta*_m eta_m - (2j+1)/2 and O_{j,m}(eta) is the 3j-symbol
bilinear in eta. Note: h is a Grassmann-even quantity (a polynomial in eta*_m eta_n products).

**Equations of motion.** The mean field dynamics is given by the Grassmann Hamilton equations:

    i d/dt eta_m = partial h / partial eta*_m

These are first-order ODEs in Grassmann variables. Explicitly:

    i d/dt eta_m = -(J/3) [3 eta_m - 3 sum_m' K_{m,m'}(eta*, eta) eta_{m'} ]

where K_{m,m'} encodes the quartic interaction through the 3j symbols.

**Self-consistency.** In the static (thermal equilibrium) case, the mean field
equations become self-consistency conditions for the Green's function:

    G(m, m'; tau) = -<T_tau psi_m(tau) psi^dag_{m'}(0)>

The SU(2) invariance implies G(m, m'; tau) = G(tau) delta_{m,m'}. The self-consistency
equation for G(tau) is precisely the melonic Schwinger-Dyson equation of Section 3 of
the paper. This is the central connection: MEAN FIELD = MELONIC.


### III.D. Product State Ansatz for Large j

**Factorized states.** In the simplest mean field approximation, consider product states:

    |Psi> = tensor product over m of (alpha_m |0>_m + beta_m |1>_m)

where |0>_m and |1>_m are the empty and occupied states at site m. The parameters
satisfy |alpha_m|^2 + |beta_m|^2 = 1.

**Occupation number profile.** The mean field reduces to specifying an occupation profile:

    f(m) = <psi^dag_m psi_m> = |beta_m|^2

The SU(2) symmetry constrains this profile. For a state with J_3 = 0 and R = 0,
f(m) should be symmetric: f(m) = f(-m). For the BPS states near maximal J_3:

    f(m) = 1 for m = 1, 2, ..., j  (northern hemisphere filled)
    f(m) = 0 for m = -j, ..., -1    (southern hemisphere empty)
    f(0) = 0 or 1                    (equator: distinguishes the two BPS states)

This is the "spherical cap" picture described in Section 7 of the paper (see their
Figure 7). The fermions are viewed as living on S^2 with a magnetic field, and the
maximal-J_3 state corresponds to filling the northern hemisphere.

**Variational energy.** For a product state with occupation profile f(m):

    <H> = (J/3) [ N - 3(sum_m f(m) - N/2 + j + 1/2)
           + 3 sum_m |sum_{m1<m2} C^j_{m1,m2,-m} sqrt(f(m1) f(m2) (1-f(m1))(1-f(m2)))|^2 + ...]

The quartic term requires going beyond the simple product state ansatz, as the
expectation of O^dag O in a product state involves connected correlations.

**Connection to Schwinger-Dyson equations.** In the large-j limit, the mean field
self-consistency equation for G(tau) is:

    G^{-1}(omega) = -i omega + Sigma(omega)
    Sigma(tau) = -J^2 G(tau)^2 G(-tau)

This is the N=2 SYK Schwinger-Dyson equation (Fu-Gaiotto-Maldacena-Sachdev), as
established in Section 3 of the paper. The conformal solution gives:

    G(tau) ~ sgn(tau) / |tau|^{1/3}   (Delta_psi = 1/6)


### III.E. Hepp-Lieb Theorem Analog

**Formal statement.** The analog of the Hepp-Lieb theorem for this model would be:

    For suitable initial states |Psi_j> (product states, or slight perturbations thereof)
    and for local observables O_m (involving finitely many sites as j -> infinity):

        lim_{j -> infinity} <Psi_j(t)| O_m |Psi_j(t)> = expectation in the classical
        Grassmann evolution

    with corrections of order 1/j (or more precisely, (log j)/j as shown by the
    12j symbol asymptotics in the paper).

**What serves as the "classical limit"?**
- The classical phase space is the Grassmann supermanifold parameterized by {eta_m, eta*_m}
- The classical dynamics is the Grassmann Hamilton equations i d/dt eta_m = partial h / partial eta*_m
- For even observables (occupation numbers, energy), the classical expectations reduce
  to ordinary real numbers after performing Grassmann integration

**Connection to melonic dominance.**
- The melonic Schwinger-Dyson equations ARE the mean field equations
- Non-melonic diagrams = quantum corrections beyond mean field
- The first correction (12j symbol) is suppressed by (log j)/j (equation 35 of paper)
- Higher corrections involve further powers of 1/sqrt(j) (possibly with logarithms)
- This is consistent with the Hepp-Lieb framework where corrections are O(1/N) = O(1/j)

**Rigorous formulation challenges.**
- The Grassmann coherent state formalism does not directly yield a classical phase space
  in the usual sense. One needs the algebraic framework of supermanifolds.
- The appropriate notion of "convergence" must be specified for Grassmann-valued quantities.
- The non-locality of the interaction (all-to-all coupling through 3j symbols) means the
  standard nearest-neighbor Hepp-Lieb theorems do not directly apply. However, the
  SU(2) structure provides sufficient control.


### III.F. Variational Mean Field for BPS States

**BPS condition.** A BPS state satisfies H|Psi> = 0, equivalently Q|Psi> = Q^dag|Psi> = 0.
In the mean field language, this becomes:

    q(eta*, eta) = 0  and  q*(eta*, eta) = 0

where q is the classical supercharge (the coherent state expectation of Q).

**Constrained minimization.** Minimize <H> subject to fixed R-charge:

    min_{f(m)} <H>_f  subject to  sum_m f(m) = 3R + (2j+1)/2

The constraint R = N_psi/3 restricts the mean field manifold.

**Fuzzy sphere picture.** For the BPS states near maximal J_3, the mean field state is a
"cap" on S^2: fill all modes with m >= m_0 for some cutoff m_0. The cap size determines
the R-charge. In the CFT_2 language:
- The "cap" states correspond to the maximal-angular-momentum states
- The boundary of the cap is the equator, and edge excitations generate the
  H^{+/-} Hilbert space
- The BPS condition selects specific cap configurations

**Connection to maximal-angular-momentum states.** Section 6 of the paper gives the exact
energies for the maximal-spin states at each R-charge. The mean field predicts:

    H = J (9 sqrt(3) / (pi j)) (R^2 - 1/36)

for the lowest-energy state at given R. This emerges from the large-j asymptotics of the
3j symbols (equation 40 of the paper).


### III.G. Fluctuations Around Mean Field

**Gaussian fluctuations = Random Phase Approximation (RPA).** Expand around the mean
field solution eta_m = eta^{(0)}_m + delta eta_m. To quadratic order:

    h = h_0 + sum_{m,n} M_{mn} delta eta*_m delta eta_n + ...

The matrix M determines the spectrum of fluctuations. Its eigenvalues give the
quasiparticle energies, which correspond to the operator dimensions in the conformal
regime.

**Kernel equations.** The operator dimensions h satisfy (from Section 5 of the paper):

    1 = kappa_tilde(l) kappa^s(h)   or   1 = kappa_tilde(l) kappa^a(h)

where kappa^{s,a}(h) are the symmetric/antisymmetric kernels (involving Gamma functions)
and:

    kappa_tilde(l) = {j j j; j j l} / {j j j; j j 0}

In the large-j limit:

    kappa_tilde(l) = P_l(-1/2)

where P_l is the Legendre polynomial. The fluctuation analysis should reproduce these
kernel equations. The key connection: the kernel equations are the eigenvalue equations
for the fluctuation matrix M at the conformal mean field solution.

**Specific predictions.**
- l=0: kappa_tilde(0) = 1, recovering the singlet channel (identical to SYK)
- l=1: kappa_tilde(1) = -1/2, giving h = 1/2 (the conserved SU(2) current)
- Large l: kappa_tilde(l) -> 0, dimensions approach free-field values
  h ~ Delta_psi + Delta_b + 2k = 1/6 + 2/3 + 2k = 5/6 + 2k

**Connection to RPA.** The RPA corresponds to resumming bubble diagrams (ring diagrams)
around the mean field. In the melonic context:
- Mean field = melonic Schwinger-Dyson equations
- RPA = ladder diagrams (the four-point kernel)
- Beyond RPA = non-melonic diagrams (suppressed by (log j)/j)


### III.H. Temperature-Dependent Mean Field

**Self-consistent equations at finite temperature.** The thermal mean field equations are:

    G^{-1}(omega_n) = -i omega_n + Sigma(omega_n)
    Sigma(tau) = -J^2 G(tau)^2 G(-tau)

where omega_n = (2n+1) pi / beta are Matsubara frequencies.

**Phase structure.** The paper (via Heydeman et al.) predicts:
- For |R| < R_c = (sqrt(2)-1)N/3: the low-energy physics is approximately conformal,
  with Schwarzian corrections
- For |R| > R_c: the conformal regime is lost, and the system transitions to a
  different phase

The mean field equations should exhibit this transition:
- Below R_c: the conformal solution G(tau) ~ 1/|tau|^{1/3} is stable
- Above R_c: the conformal solution becomes unstable, and a new (non-conformal) mean
  field solution takes over

**Comparison with exact diagonalization.** The thermal properties computed from ED
(Section I.B above) directly test the mean field predictions:
- Energy vs temperature curves
- Entropy at the phase transition
- R-charge susceptibility anomaly at R_c

**Temperature-dependent dimensions.** At finite temperature, the operator dimensions
receive corrections. The leading correction is of Schwarzian type:

    delta(h) ~ 1 / (beta J)

The mean field RPA analysis at finite temperature should reproduce these corrections.

## IV. Connections Between Approaches

### IV.A. Validation Chain

    Exact diagonalization (small j) --validates--> Mean field predictions (large j)
                |
                |--validates--> Tensor network results (intermediate j)

1. **ED validates mean field.** For j = 3, 5, 7, 9, 11: compare exact spectra,
   correlators, and thermodynamic quantities with mean field predictions. The agreement
   should improve with increasing j, with discrepancies scaling as (log j)/j.

2. **ED validates tensor networks.** For j <= 11, compare DMRG ground state energies
   and BPS state counts with exact results. This calibrates the tensor network methods
   for use at larger j.

3. **Tensor networks bridge the gap.** For j = 13, 15, 17 (beyond ED but below the
   mean field regime), tensor networks provide data points that interpolate between
   the exact small-j results and the large-j mean field predictions.


### IV.B. Complementary Strengths

| Method | j range | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|--------|---------|-----------|------------|
| ED | 3-11 (13 partial) | Exact, full spectrum | Exponential scaling |
| Tensor networks | 3-17+ | Ground state, low-lying states | Bond dimension limits for excited states |
| Mean field | j >> 1 | Analytic predictions | Only asymptotically exact |


### IV.C. Cross-cutting Questions

1. **BPS state structure.** All three methods can probe BPS states:
   - ED: exact count and wavefunctions
   - TN: DMRG targeting, entanglement structure
   - MF: variational BPS ansatz, CFT_2 factorization

2. **Thermalization and chaos.** The chaotic nature of the model can be probed:
   - ED: SFF, level statistics, OTOCs
   - TN: real-time entanglement growth, quench dynamics
   - MF: Lyapunov exponent from four-point kernel

3. **Two classical limits.** The model has two distinct simplification regimes:
   - Large j at fixed charges: melonic/mean field limit (Section III)
   - Large SU(2) charge at fixed j: emergent CFT_2 (Section 7 of paper)
   These are different corners of parameter space. Understanding how they connect
   (especially for intermediate values) requires all three methods.

## Appendix A: Key Formulas for Implementation

### A.1. 3j Symbol Computation

The Wigner 3j symbols C^j_{m1, m2, m3} = (j j j; m1 m2 m3) can be computed using:
- Racah formula (exact, involves factorials)
- Recursion relations (numerically stable for moderate j)
- Software: GSL (C), SymPy/Wigner (Python), WignerSymbols.jl (Julia)

Selection rules: m1 + m2 + m3 = 0, and all |m_i| <= j.
For odd j: C^j is antisymmetric under permutations of (m1, m2, m3).

Large-j asymptotics (for |m_i| << j):

    C^j_{m1 m2 m3} ~ -(1/j) sqrt(2/(pi sqrt(3))) cos(3 pi j/2 + 2pi(m1-m2)/3)

### A.2. Normal-Ordered Hamiltonian Matrix Elements

For two Fock states |F> = psi^dag_{a1} ... psi^dag_{an} |0> and |F'> = psi^dag_{b1} ... psi^dag_{bn} |0>:

1. Diagonal (free) part: <F|N_psi|F> = n - (2j+1)/2
2. Quartic part: <F| O^dag_{j,m} O_{j,m} |F'> requires the sets {a_i} and {b_i}
   to differ by exactly two elements (one creation, one annihilation pair from each O).
   The matrix element involves products of 3j symbols and Fermi signs.

### A.3. SU(2) Casimir

    J^2 = j(j+1)(N_psi + j + 1/2) + 2 sum_{m<n} mn psi^dag_m psi^dag_n psi_n psi_m
          + sum_{m,n} sqrt((j-m)(j+m+1)(j+n)(j-n+1)) psi^dag_{m+1} psi^dag_{n-1} psi_n psi_m

### A.4. Schwarzian Predictions

Energy gap at fixed R:

    E_gap = J / (8 N alpha_S) * (|R| - 1/2)^2,    alpha_S ~ 0.00842

Near-extremal entropy:

    S ~ 2 pi sqrt(2 alpha_S N E / J)

### A.5. CFT_2 Predictions (Large SU(2) Charge)

Hamiltonian:

    H = J (6 sqrt(3) / (pi j)) L_0^z

where L_0^z = (1/3)(p^2 - 1/4)/2 + N_tilde, with p = 3R (half-integer), N_tilde integer.

Lowest energy at fixed R:

    H = J (9 sqrt(3) / (pi j)) (R^2 - 1/36)

BPS partition function:

    Z_BPS = 2 prod_{k>=0} 1/((1-q^{1+3k})(1-q^{2+3k}))

## Appendix C: Comparison with N=2 SYK

Since the melonic limit of the Biggs-Lin-Maldacena model reproduces N=2 SYK, the
extensive SYK literature provides benchmarks and techniques.

Key SYK references for comparison:
- Fu, Gaiotto, Maldacena, Sachdev, PRD 95 (2017): N=2 SYK definition, SD equations
- Heydeman, Iliesiu, Turiaci, Zhao, JHEP 2301 (2023): phase transitions with chemical potential
- Cotler, Gur-Ari, Hanada, Polchinski, Saad, Shenker, Stanford, Streicher, Tezuka,
  JHEP 1705 (2017): SFF and chaos in SYK

Key differences from SYK:
1. Global SU(2) symmetry (absent in SYK)
2. Non-random couplings (3j symbols vs random tensors)
3. Non-melonic corrections scale as (log j)/j rather than 1/N
4. Emergent CFT_2 at large SU(2) charge (no analog in SYK)
5. Sporadic BPS states at unexpected R-charges
