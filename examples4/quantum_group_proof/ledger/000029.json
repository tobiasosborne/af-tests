These states |0_tilde\u003e_pm satisfy Q_q|0_tilde\u003e = Q_q^dagger|0_tilde\u003e = 0 because the pair operator O_{j,m}(q) annihilates them (no room for additional/fewer pairs at maximal spin). The argument is topological in nature, depending only on angular momentum quantum numbers not on q.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"26f610ad81da0a516d74c9ee2e7903abdb8446bb8edb9906f22b82eb481af693","created":"2026-02-11T17:24:29.1126453Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
