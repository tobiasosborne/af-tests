There are three independent errors:\n\n(1) THE CLASSICAL RESULT IS CORRECTLY CITED BUT CANNOT BE q-DEFORMED BY PREFACTORS ALONE: The classical 12j_{(II)} asymptotics from Garoufalidis-van der Veen (Geom. Topol. 2013, arXiv:0902.3113) are correctly described in the BLM paper eq.(2.10)/(12jasmtot): the cube spin network has asymptotics involving (log j)/j^4 leading + oscillatory/j^{9/2} subleading, giving (log j)/j suppression relative to melonic vacuum ~j. However, this is a CLASSICAL (q=1) result. The Garoufalidis-van der Veen paper explicitly treats classical spin networks. Their companion paper on quantum spin networks at a fixed root of unity (Math. Ann. 352, 2012) establishes an existence theorem for asymptotics of quantum spin networks of arbitrary valency using G-functions, but does NOT establish that the quantum asymptotics are polynomial corrections to the classical ones.\n\n(2) THE q-12j_{(II)} INHERITS THE EXPONENTIAL PATHOLOGY FROM q-6j SYMBOLS: The 12j symbol of the second kind is defined as 12j_{(II)} = sum_{x=0}^{2j} (2x+1) {j j j; j j x}^4 (BLM paper Appendix, eq. following '12jnorm'). This is a sum of FOURTH POWERS of 6j symbols. For fixed q \u003e 0, q != 1, the quantum 6j symbol {j j j; j j x}_q has asymptotics governed by HYPERBOLIC geometry, not Euclidean geometry (Taylor-Woodward, Selecta Math 2005; Costantino, Geom. Topol. 2007; Belletti-Yang, J. Topology 2025). The exponential growth rate equals the volume of an associated generalized hyperbolic tetrahedron. Since 12j_{(II)}_q is a sum of fourth powers of such exponentially-growing/decaying terms, its asymptotics will be dominated by exponential contributions, not the polynomial (log j)/j^{3/2} of the classical case.\n\nSpecifically: if the q-6j symbol scales as exp(n * V_hyp) for some hyperbolic volume V_hyp, then {6j}_q^4 ~ exp(4n * V_hyp), and the sum over x will be dominated by the term maximizing this exponential. The resulting q-12j_{(II)} would scale exponentially in j, not polynomially. The phrase 'matching the classical scaling up to q-dependent prefactors' implicitly assumes the q-correction is multiplicative and sub-exponential; the literature shows it is exponential.\n\n(3) NODE INHERITS THE 1.2.3 DEFECT: Node 1.2.5 states the q-12j gives '(log j)/j suppression of non-melonic diagrams relative to melonic ones.' But this suppression analysis depends on the melonic vacuum scaling ~j (from N^2/[N]_q with N=2j+1), and on the 12j contribution being ~j*(log j)/j. For fixed q != 1, [N]_q = [2j+1]_q ~ q^{2j}/(q - q^{-1}) grows exponentially. The melonic vacuum is no longer ~j but grows exponentially. Meanwhile, the 12j contribution is ALSO exponential (from point 2). The relative suppression (log j)/j is a ratio that only makes sense when both numerator and denominator are polynomial in j; when both are exponential, the relative suppression becomes a ratio of exponentials, which could be O(1) or exponentially large/small, not (log j)/j.\n\nCONCLUSION: The classical (log j)/j^{3/2} asymptotics for the 12j_{(II)} are well-established (Garoufalidis-van der Veen 2013). But there exists NO result in the literature establishing that q-deformed 12j symbols for fixed q \u003e 0, q != 1, have the same polynomial asymptotics 'up to q-dependent prefactors.' The q-deformation changes the underlying geometry from Euclidean to hyperbolic, turning polynomial asymptotics into exponential ones. This is the same fundamental error as in node 1.2.3 (exponential vs polynomial for q-6j), amplified by the fourth-power structure of the 12j_{(II)} definition.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
