Therefore Q_q^dagger is the Hermitian adjoint of Q_q in the standard Fock space inner product. It follows that H_q = Q_q Q_q^dagger + Q_q^dagger Q_q \u003e= 0 as an operator, with ker(H_q) = ker(Q_q) intersect ker(Q_q^dagger).","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"335863281cac53c2edc0fe392b1b5795cea940fbc241935adbddbb507c8ffbaf","created":"2026-02-11T17:23:47.041990323Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
