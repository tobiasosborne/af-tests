The BLM paper itself (eq. 6jasym, line 572 of Draft.tex) correctly writes cos(6(j+1/2)arccos(1/3) + 3pi/4). The Roberts (1999) formula uses pi/4 with EXTERIOR dihedral angles theta_ext = pi - arccos(1/3); rewriting in terms of the interior angle arccos(1/3) shifts the phase by 6(j+1/2)pi = (6j+3)pi (always an odd multiple of pi), converting pi/4 to 3pi/4. The node contradicts its own source. (2) PREFACTOR ERROR: The node claims {j j j;j j j} ~ 1/sqrt(12 pi j), giving j^{-1/2} scaling. The correct Ponzano-Regge prefactor is 1/sqrt(12 pi V) with V = (j+1/2)^3/(6 sqrt 2), yielding 1/(2^{1/4} sqrt(pi) j^{3/2}), so the 6j symbol scales as j^{-3/2}, not j^{-1/2}. The BLM paper correctly shows N^2 * {6j} ~ sqrt(j) because the N^2 ~ j^2 factor compensates. The node conflates the bare 6j symbol with the full diagram amplitude including the N^2 prefactor. The qualitative conclusion (1/sqrt(j) suppression of tetrahedron diagrams) and the 3D gravity connection are correct, but the explicit formula is wrong in both the phase and the prefactor.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
