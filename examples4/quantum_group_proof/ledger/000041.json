The full q-Regge symmetries are NOT established in the standard literature (Kirillov-Reshetikhin 1988, Groza-Kachurik-Klimyk 1990). (2) What IS established is the simpler column-permutation symmetry: odd permutation of columns of the q-3j symbol gives phase (-1)^{j1+j2+j3}, with no q-dependent correction. This follows from the q-analog of the van der Waerden formula. (3) Only this column-permutation symmetry (not full Regge symmetry) is needed for the antisymmetry claim. The proof should cite the specific q-3j column-permutation symmetry (e.g., Eq.(3.12) in Groza-Kachurik-Klimyk, J.Math.Phys.31(1990)2769) rather than the unsupported 'quantum Regge symmetries'.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
