This has the same structure as the undeformed case but with [N]_q replacing N, ensuring the melonic Schwinger-Dyson equations close.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"c5b206bb77dd4313b25f50d01d2d841e96ef81e3c1103b25187b6a8263c0d300","created":"2026-02-11T17:24:07.03811905Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
