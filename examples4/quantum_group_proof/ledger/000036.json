The quantum 6j symbols become the building blocks of the Turaev-Viro state sum TV_r(M) = sum_{colorings} prod_{edges} dim_q(j_e) prod_{tetrahedra} {6j}_q, which is a topological invariant of the 3-manifold M. This is the q-deformation of the (formal) Ponzano-Regge sum.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"686793fba35932bdaa037eb414b3a3c035a0d882e12fbb6b48607388e0a36ad0","created":"2026-02-11T17:24:53.91233902Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
