When q = exp(2pi i/r) is a root of unity, these give the Turaev-Viro state sum invariants of 3-manifolds, generalizing the Ponzano-Regge/3D-gravity connection of the undeformed (q=1) BLM model. This provides a direct link between the q-BLM model and 3D Chern-Simons/topological gravity.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"eb70461194ed8cb30d1f356b24824c34f820f7200efedd73b1d60883aadbd4ef","created":"2026-02-11T17:23:20.048586948Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
