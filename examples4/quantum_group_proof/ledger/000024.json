This follows from the quantum analog of the symmetry property: the q-9j symbol changes sign under a column permutation that leaves it invariant when 3j is odd, forcing it to zero.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"19348730c2d1ae9e7297b8997364990c0486a466f9fd05b2c0d26d62ba338403","created":"2026-02-11T17:24:07.038127154Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
