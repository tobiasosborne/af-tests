This follows from the quantum Regge symmetries of q-3j symbols and the fact that 3j is odd.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"0611ba64e1286c28efd7f84643dc319d0028b5234c7f4d6ac4383c434ef9e462","created":"2026-02-11T17:23:47.041953989Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
