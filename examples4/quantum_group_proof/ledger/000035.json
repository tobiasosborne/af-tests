The q-deformation modifies the edge lengths and dihedral angles of the dual tetrahedron, corresponding to a deformed simplicial geometry. The 1/sqrt(j) suppression factor is preserved.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"d80a8a68a7c38ba5531a87186b6febadd53be8d70f5a4c64035def5bd1504748","created":"2026-02-11T17:24:53.91233449Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
