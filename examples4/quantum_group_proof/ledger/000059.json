{"type":"node_validated","timestamp":"2026-02-11T18:25:31.760590133Z","node_id":"1.1","note":"Node 1.1 is ACCEPTED despite challenged children 1.1.1 and 1.1.3, because neither challenge undermines the parent's core claims. (1) Q_q^2=0: The challenge to 1.1.1 targets the JUSTIFICATION (citing non-existent 'quantum Regge symmetries') but NOT the CONCLUSION (total antisymmetry). The established column-permutation symmetry of q-3j symbols (Groza-Kachurik-Klimyk, J.Math.Phys.31(1990)2769, Eq.3.12) gives phase (-1)^{j1+j2+j3} under odd column permutations; with j1=j2=j3=j and 3j odd, this yields the requisite antisymmetry. Combined with validated node 1.1.2, Q_q^2=0 holds. (2) H_q\u003e=0: Node 1.1.4 is validated — q-3j symbols are real for q\u003e0, so Q_q^dagger is the true adjoint, and {Q_q,Q_q^dagger}\u003e=0 by the standard positivity argument. (3) N=2 SUSY: The node claims N=2 supersymmetry meaning H={Q,Q^dagger} with Q^2=0=(Q^dagger)^2. This is a structural definition satisfied by (1)+(2); it does NOT require U_q(su(2)) covariance (which is the subject of the challenged node 1.1.3). Node 1.1.3's covariance claim is logically independent of and not invoked by the parent node 1.1. CAVEAT: The phrase 'N=2 supersymmetry' in node 1.1 should be understood in the narrow algebraic sense (two nilpotent supercharges generating H as anticommutator), not as implying any quantum group symmetry enhancement. The U_q covariance question (1.1.3) remains open and has a genuine mathematical obstacle (non-cocommutative coproduct vs undeformed fermion statistics)."}
