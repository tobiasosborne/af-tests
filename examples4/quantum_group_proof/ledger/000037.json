Thus the non-melonic corrections to the q-BLM model at q = root of unity are controlled by 3D Chern-Simons theory, providing a direct link between the q-deformed melonic model and 3D topological quantum gravity.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"dbe336203b0e5bde4aa12a3efc924aef821191a8341600a73b1c8e9926c25ff6","created":"2026-02-11T17:24:53.91234053Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
