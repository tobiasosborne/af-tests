Its large-j asymptotics are controlled by the quantum Racah formula. For generic q \u003e 0 (not a root of unity), the quantum 6j symbol has the same 1/sqrt(j) suppression as the classical case, giving a 1/sqrt(j) suppression of the tetrahedron diagram.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"8b9297f232fcd8059157201c83ce4446dffd453bdc5dd6bff620dc0c072dbd18","created":"2026-02-11T17:24:07.038123291Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
