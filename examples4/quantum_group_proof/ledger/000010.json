The leading correction (quantum 12j symbol) scales as (log j)/j, matching the undeformed case up to q-dependent prefactors.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"11fb4eb812c54e0ca32bf482085601e80a4d91a7fa6923e89af189352b23c674","created":"2026-02-11T17:23:20.048578753Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
