The melonic dominance at large j persists in both regimes, providing a disorder-free quantum mechanical model with a tunable gravitational dual.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"d48c797e3510531c69fda2b49bb5f429d5a2f32a5ae5ca66ff733da4f1e663e8","created":"2026-02-11T17:24:53.91234204Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
