Its large-j asymptotics scale as (log j)/j^{3/2}, giving an overall (log j)/j suppression of the non-melonic diagrams relative to the melonic ones, matching the classical scaling up to q-dependent prefactors.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"77438ca532ed13970e18149ac7d473743fa05f36f7afe081781598f7530b5b46","created":"2026-02-11T17:24:07.038128473Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
