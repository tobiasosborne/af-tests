This is the quantum analog of 3j orthogonality and follows from the completeness of quantum Clebsch-Gordan coefficients in the tensor product decomposition of U_q(su(2)) representations.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"39b85f78d9846bb6db6e6fa06ffe592abbeccd802896d1d8512b790b5fd39cfe","created":"2026-02-11T17:24:07.038106989Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
