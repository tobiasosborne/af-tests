{"type":"challenge_raised","timestamp":"2026-02-11T18:25:14.305811457Z","challenge_id":"ch-c1b605377fd56638","node_id":"1.2","target":"statement","reason":"Node 1.2 claims melonic dominance in the large-j limit for the q-deformed BLM model, with non-melonic corrections 'suppressed by powers of 1/j' and a leading correction scaling as '(log j)/j.' This summary claim is FATALLY UNDERMINED by the challenges to 3 of its 5 children (1.2.2, 1.2.3, 1.2.5), and the 2 validated children (1.2.1, 1.2.4) are insufficient to rescue it. The specific failures are:\n\n(A) THE SUPPRESSION MECHANISM IS BROKEN (from 1.2.3 challenge): Melonic dominance requires that non-melonic diagrams are SUPPRESSED relative to melonic ones. The first non-melonic correction involves the quantum 6j symbol. For fixed q \u003e 0, q != 1, the mathematical literature (Taylor-Woodward 2005, Costantino 2007, Belletti-Yang 2025) establishes that quantum 6j symbols have EXPONENTIAL asymptotics governed by hyperbolic tetrahedron volumes, NOT the polynomial 1/sqrt(j) suppression of the classical (q=1) case. If the 6j contribution grows or decays exponentially while the melonic contribution scales polynomially (or exponentially at a different rate), the claimed polynomial suppression '1/j' is simply wrong. Melonic dominance may fail entirely for fixed q != 1.\n\n(B) THE LEADING CORRECTION FORMULA IS WRONG (from 1.2.5 challenge): The claimed (log j)/j scaling for the quantum 12j symbol inherits the exponential pathology from 1.2.3, amplified by the fourth-power structure of the 12j_{(II)} definition. No result in the literature establishes polynomial asymptotics for q-12j symbols at fixed q != 1.\n\n(C) THE SELF-ENERGY FORMULA IS WRONG (from 1.2.2 challenge): The claimed Sigma = J/[N]_q is incorrect even at the melonic level. The classical self-energy is J (not J/N), so the q-deformed version depends critically on unspecified vertex normalization conventions. This undermines the quantitative foundation of the melonic sector itself.\n\n(D) VALIDATED CHILDREN DO NOT SAVE THE CLAIM: The q-bubble identity (1.2.1) shows the melonic SD equations CLOSE -- it guarantees self-consistency of the melonic sector. But self-consistency is NOT dominance. Melonic dominance additionally requires that all non-melonic contributions are suppressed, which is precisely what 1.2.3 and 1.2.5 fail to establish. The q-9j vanishing (1.2.4) removes one specific non-melonic correction but does not address the tetrahedron (6j) or 12j contributions that are the problematic ones.\n\n(E) THE REGIME DISTINCTION IS FATAL: Node 1.2 does not distinguish between (i) q -\u003e 1 with j -\u003e infinity (where classical melonic dominance is recovered as a limiting case), (ii) q = exp(2pi i/r) root of unity with r -\u003e infinity (where q-6j asymptotics approach the classical Ponzano-Regge formula), and (iii) fixed q \u003e 0, q != 1, with j -\u003e infinity (where the asymptotics are fundamentally different -- exponential rather than polynomial). The claim as stated ('for q \u003e 0 real, not root of unity') falls squarely in regime (iii), where melonic dominance is NOT established and may be false.\n\nCONCLUSION: The summary claim of polynomial melonic dominance for generic fixed q != 1 is unsupported. The node conflates the well-established classical (q=1) melonic dominance with a purported q-deformation that does not preserve the polynomial suppression structure. A corrected version of this node would need to either (a) restrict to q near 1 (perturbative regime) where corrections to classical asymptotics are small, (b) restrict to roots of unity approaching 1, or (c) establish exponential melonic dominance (showing melonic diagrams grow exponentially FASTER than non-melonic ones), which would require a completely different analysis.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
