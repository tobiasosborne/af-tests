This contains two errors: (1) In the classical BLM model, the melonic self-energy is J (independent of N), NOT J/N. The paper (line 526) states explicitly that the bubble gives a factor of J 'independent of N' because the 1/N from the bubble identity cancels the N from the two vertex factors (each vertex carries sqrt(N*J)). So the claimed replacement N -\u003e [N]_q is a misunderstanding of the classical computation. (2) The claim does not specify the normalization of the q-supercharge Q_q. If Q_q retains the classical prefactor sqrt(2*J*N), then the self-energy becomes J*N/[N]_q (not J/[N]_q), which is q-dependent and breaks the N-independence that makes the classical SD equations close identically to SYK. If instead Q_q uses sqrt(2*J*[N]_q), the self-energy is exactly J (q-independent), and the SD equations close identically -- but then the result is NOT J/[N]_q as claimed. In either case, the formula Sigma = J/[N]_q is wrong. The SD equations can still close (with modified effective coupling in the first case, or identically in the second), but the specific claim as stated is incorrect and the argument for closure needs the vertex normalization to be specified.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
