The proof mechanism from the BLM paper generalizes to the quantum case: (1) The q-9j symbol is a contraction of six q-3j symbols paralleling the classical definition. (2) The column-swap symmetry of q-3j symbols preserves the classical phase (-1)^{j1+j2+j3} -- this is established in the literature (Vaksman-Soibelman, Kirillov-Reshetikhin, Biedenharn-Lohe) where q appears only in magnitudes (q-factorials) not in phase structure. (3) For all spins j (odd), swapping first two columns of each row q-3j symbol gives (-1)^{3j}=-1 each, total (-1)^3=-1. (4) Relabeling of dummy summation indices is q-independent. (5) Result equals minus itself hence vanishes. Non-cocommutativity of Uq(su2) coproduct does NOT affect this because the column-swap phase is a property of the 1-dimensional intertwiner space for j x j x j -\u003e 0 at generic q. Literature: Alisauskas JMP 2000 derives q-9j from q-6j preserving classical structure; tetrahedral symmetry of q-6j established for fusion categories (arXiv:2106.16186)."}
