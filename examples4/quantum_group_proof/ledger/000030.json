For q=1 this reproduces Z^BPS from BLM. The total count D^BPS_q = Z^BPS_q(1) = 2 times 3^j is q-independent (it counts states topologically).","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"b248a586a3069198e083f1266cdd22d80489e5f666079139670dc42488cfe261","created":"2026-02-11T17:24:29.112649445Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
