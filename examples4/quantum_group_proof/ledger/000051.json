(1) Q_q|0~\u003e_pm = 0 IS topological: it follows from the q-3j weight selection rule m1+m2+m3=0, which is preserved by q-deformation since the Cartan subalgebra of U_q(su(2)) is undeformed. For |0~\u003e_- = psi^dag_1...psi^dag_j|0\u003e, the operator Q_q = sum C^j(q)_{m1,m2,m3} psi_{m1}psi_{m2}psi_{m3} tries to annihilate 3 fermions with m-values summing to zero, but all occupied orbitals have m\u003e=1, so three positive integers cannot sum to zero. Similarly for |0~\u003e_+, all occupied orbitals have m\u003e=0, so m1+m2+m3=0 forces m1=m2=m3=0, but C^j_{0,0,0}(q)=0 for odd j (q-antisymmetry). (2) HOWEVER, Q^dag_q|0~\u003e_pm = 0 does NOT follow from a topological argument. Q^dag_q creates 3 fermions with m1+m2+m3=0; since some target orbitals (m\u003c=0 for |0~\u003e_-, or m\u003c0 for |0~\u003e_+) are unoccupied, Pauli exclusion does not block all terms. The BPS condition requires BOTH Q and Q^dag to annihilate the state, i.e., E_q=0. In the undeformed paper (BLM arXiv:2601.08908, Appendix eq.(A.3)-(A.10)), E(1/6)=0 is proved by a DELICATE numerical cancellation using 3j orthogonality (the bubble identity sum = 1/(2j+1)) and a symmetry argument partitioning (++-)  terms into 6 equal sectors. For the q-deformed case: (a) the bubble identity changes to 1/[2j+1]_q, (b) the q-Regge symmetries relating (++-)  sectors differ from the classical case, and (c) the specific cancellation -(j+2)/3 + (2j+1)[1/(2j+1) + (j-1)/(3(2j+1))] = 0 has no obvious q-analog. The node provides NO computation or proof that the q-energy is zero at R=pm 1/6. The characterization as 'topological, depending only on angular momentum quantum numbers not on q' is misleading -- it correctly describes Q_q annihilation but incorrectly characterizes Q^dag_q annihilation, which depends on the specific VALUES of q-3j symbols.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
