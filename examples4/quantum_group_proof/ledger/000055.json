It asserts that for fixed q \u003e 0 real (not a root of unity), quantum 6j symbols {j,j,j;j,j,j}_q have '1/sqrt(j) suppression factor preserved' with 'oscillatory terms involving the q-deformed Regge action.' This is contradicted by the established mathematical literature on three independent grounds:\n\n(1) EXPONENTIAL, NOT POLYNOMIAL ASYMPTOTICS: Taylor-Woodward (Selecta Math 2005, arXiv:math/0305113) established that quantum 6j symbols for U_q(sl_2) with q real positive correspond to HYPERBOLIC tetrahedra. Costantino (Geom. Topol. 2007, arXiv:math/0611399) computed the asymptotic growth rate and proved it equals the volume of the associated generalized hyperbolic tetrahedron — meaning the growth is EXPONENTIAL: |{6j}_q| ~ exp(n * Vol_hyp). Belletti-Yang (J. Topology 2025, arXiv:2308.13864) further established that the exponential growth rate equals the suitably defined volume of a generalized hyperbolic tetrahedron, and that this volume can be negative (causing exponential DECAY). None of these results show 1/sqrt(j) polynomial suppression. The 1/sqrt(j) behavior is specific to the classical q=1 (Euclidean tetrahedra, Ponzano-Regge) regime.\n\n(2) NO 'q-DEFORMED REGGE ACTION' EXISTS FOR FIXED REAL q: The node invokes a 'q-deformed Regge action' as the phase of oscillatory terms. For fixed q \u003e 0, q != 1, the geometry is HYPERBOLIC, not a smooth deformation of Euclidean Regge geometry. The relevant geometric quantity is the HYPERBOLIC VOLUME (Lobachevsky function / dilogarithm values), not a deformed Regge action. The Regge action is inherently Euclidean (it involves deficit angles of flat simplicial geometry). There is no standard mathematical object called the 'q-deformed Regge action' in the literature on quantum 6j asymptotics. The correct description is: the asymptotics are controlled by hyperbolic volume via the Volume Conjecture framework (Kashaev, Murakami-Murakami, Chen-Yang), which is qualitatively different from Regge calculus.\n\n(3) 'DEFORMED SIMPLICIAL GEOMETRY' IS INCOHERENT AS STATED: The node says q-deformation 'modifies the edge lengths and dihedral angles of the dual tetrahedron, corresponding to a deformed simplicial geometry.' This conflates two different geometric regimes. For q=1, the 6j symbol corresponds to a EUCLIDEAN tetrahedron with polynomial (1/sqrt) asymptotics. For fixed q != 1, q real positive, it corresponds to a HYPERBOLIC tetrahedron with EXPONENTIAL asymptotics. These are not smooth deformations of each other — they are qualitatively different geometries with qualitatively different asymptotic behaviors. The exponential growth/decay for q != 1 is controlled by a volume (extensive in j), not by a phase (the Regge action, which is also extensive but appears in an oscillatory cosine for q=1). The transition from oscillatory-times-polynomial to exponential is a fundamental change in character, not a smooth deformation.\n\nIMPACT ON PROOF TREE: This error propagates to the parent node 1.4 and ultimately to the root claim. Node 1.4.5 claims q interpolates between Euclidean gravity (q=1) and topological gravity (q=root of unity), but the intermediate regime (fixed real q, not root of unity) actually corresponds to HYPERBOLIC 3D gravity, with exponential rather than polynomial non-melonic corrections. If the quantum 6j symbols grow exponentially, the non-melonic suppression argument of Node 1.2 collapses: melonic dominance may be DESTROYED rather than preserved for generic q != 1.\n\nCORRECT STATEMENT: For q \u003e 0 real, q != 1, not a root of unity, the quantum 6j symbol {j,j,j;j,j,j}_q has large-j asymptotics that are EXPONENTIAL in j, of the form exp(n * Vol_hyp(Delta)) where Vol_hyp(Delta) is the volume of the associated hyperbolic tetrahedron Delta determined by q and the representation labels. When Vol_hyp \u003e 0, the 6j symbols grow exponentially; when Vol_hyp \u003c 0, they decay exponentially. There is no 1/sqrt(j) polynomial envelope. The relevant geometric framework is hyperbolic geometry and the Volume Conjecture, not deformed Regge calculus.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
