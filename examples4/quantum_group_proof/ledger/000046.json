There are three independent errors:\n\n(1) EXPONENTIAL vs POLYNOMIAL ASYMPTOTICS: The mathematical literature (Taylor-Woodward, Selecta Math 2005; Costantino, Geom. Topol. 2007; Belletti-Yang, J. Topology 2025) establishes that quantum 6j symbols for Uq(sl2) with q real positive correspond to HYPERBOLIC (not Euclidean) tetrahedra, and their asymptotic growth rate is EXPONENTIAL, controlled by the volume of the associated generalized hyperbolic tetrahedron. This is fundamentally different from the classical (q=1) Ponzano-Regge formula which gives polynomial 1/sqrt(V) ~ 1/j^{3/2} scaling with oscillatory cosine. For fixed q != 1, the quantum 6j symbol generically grows or decays exponentially as exp(+/- n * Vol_hyp), not polynomially as 1/j^{3/2}. Belletti-Yang 2025 explicitly state the volume can be negative, causing exponential decay.\n\n(2) WRONG SEMICLASSICAL LIMIT: The claim conflates two different limits. The limit where quantum 6j symbols reduce to classical Ponzano-Regge asymptotics is q = exp(2pi i/r) with r -\u003e infinity (roots of unity approaching 1), NOT fixed real q \u003e 0 with j -\u003e infinity. For fixed q \u003e 0, q != 1, even the quantum dimension [2j+1]_q ~ q^{2j}/(q-q^{-1}) grows exponentially in j, already indicating fundamentally different scaling from the classical N = 2j+1.\n\n(3) 'QUANTUM RACAH FORMULA' IS NOT STANDARD TERMINOLOGY: The node claims asymptotics are 'controlled by the quantum Racah formula.' There is no standard result called 'the quantum Racah formula' that controls large-j asymptotics. The relevant results are: the Kirillov-Reshetikhin closed form (a q-hypergeometric sum), the Taylor-Woodward asymptotic conjecture (Section 9 of their paper, stated WITHOUT PROOF for q real positive), and the Belletti-Yang exponential growth theorem (2025). The node appears to be fabricating a reference.\n\nCONCLUSION: For the proof tree's claimed regime (fixed generic q \u003e 0, large j), the quantum 6j symbol {j,j,j;j,j,j}_q does NOT have the 'same 1/sqrt(j) suppression.' The suppression is generically exponential in j (either growth or decay depending on the sign of the hyperbolic volume), which would either destroy or exponentially enhance the non-melonic contribution rather than giving mild polynomial suppression.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
