Since the fermion operators are undeformed (only the couplings carry q-dependence), this trace factorizes identically to the undeformed case: W_q(r) = omega^{-N/2} (1 - omega^r)^N where omega = exp(2pi i/3) and N = 2j+1. The Witten index is q-INDEPENDENT.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"5c88dc4c41130d70118a6557fdcf8c455bfade1177989cbd7a98b9d38f151afb","created":"2026-02-11T17:24:29.112641249Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
