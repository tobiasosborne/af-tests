Without the normalization, the state sum is NOT a topological invariant, contradicting the node's own claim. Additionally, the spin truncation j \u003c= (r-2)/2 is correct, as is the characterization as a q-deformation of Ponzano-Regge. The transition from q \u003e 0 real (the regime of the rest of the proof tree) to q = exp(2pi i/r) (complex, |q|=1) is not discussed in this node, though this is arguably the responsibility of the parent node 1.4. Overall: correct qualitative content, but the explicit formula needs correction to support the topological invariance claim.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
