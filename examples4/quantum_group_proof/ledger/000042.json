Specifically: (1) The U_q(su(2)) coproduct is non-cocommutative: Delta(J_q^+) = J_q^+ ⊗ K + 1 ⊗ J_q^+, where K = q^{J_q^3}. The iterated coproduct on three factors gives Delta^(2)(J_q^+) = J_q^+ ⊗ K ⊗ K + 1 ⊗ J_q^+ ⊗ K + 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ J_q^+. This means the action on psi_{m1} psi_{m2} psi_{m3} introduces position-dependent q^m factors from K. (2) The quantum 3j symbol is indeed the intertwiner for this braided tensor product action, so sum_m C^j_q(m1,m2,m3) v_{m1} ⊗ v_{m2} ⊗ v_{m3} is U_q(su(2))-invariant in V_j ⊗ V_j ⊗ V_j with the quantum coproduct. (3) HOWEVER, the fermion operators satisfy UNDEFORMED anticommutation {psi_m, psi_n} = 0. When one writes Q_q = sum C^j_q psi_{m1} psi_{m2} psi_{m3}, the fermion product is in the ORDINARY antisymmetric part of the tensor product, not in the braided antisymmetric part defined by the R-matrix of U_q(su(2)). The ordinary transposition psi_{m1} psi_{m2} = -psi_{m2} psi_{m1} is NOT compatible with the quantum coproduct action (which is not invariant under naive transposition of factors due to the K operators). (4) For q=1, K=1 and the coproduct is cocommutative, so ordinary antisymmetry and the tensor product intertwiner property align perfectly. For q != 1, one would need BRAIDED fermions (q-fermions whose exchange is governed by the R-matrix) for the q-3j invariance to carry over to the Fock space operator Q_q. (5) The claim conflates two different structures: the q-3j symbol as an intertwiner in the representation category of U_q(su(2)) (which uses braided tensor products) and the fermion Fock space (which uses ordinary antisymmetrization). The Wigner-Eckart theorem for quantum groups applies in the braided tensor category, not directly to operators built from undeformed fermions.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
