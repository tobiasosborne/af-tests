This follows from the Wigner-Eckart theorem for quantum groups: the quantum 3j symbol with j1=j2=j3=j couples three spin-j representations to the trivial (spin-0) representation.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"e62c2beecacd00dc391982746340e11813af653cac27311e5997f145200ad950","created":"2026-02-11T17:23:47.041981263Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
