This follows from \u003cv|{Q,Q^dag}|v\u003e = ||Q^dag v||^2 + ||Q v||^2 \u003e= 0. This holds regardless of whether Q has real or complex matrix elements. The positive semi-definiteness of H = {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} is NOT an additional property that can break -- it is an automatic consequence of the definition of the adjoint.\n\nTHE ERROR IN DETAIL: The node correctly proves Q_q^dagger = -Q_q^bar (where Q_q^bar uses conjugated coefficients with creation operators). It then claims the naive H_q = Q_q * Q_q^bar + Q_q^bar * Q_q is NOT positive semi-definite because Q_q^bar is not the Fock-space adjoint. This is true but irrelevant -- {Q_q, Q_q^bar} is NOT the Hamiltonian. The actual Hamiltonian is H = {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} = -{Q_q, Q_q^bar}, which IS \u003e= 0 (since {Q_q, Q_q^bar} \u003c= 0).\n\nNUMERICAL VERIFICATION: I constructed Q with random complex antisymmetric cubic coefficients (simulating root-of-unity q-3j symbols) for N=7 (j=3). Result: {Q, Q^dagger} has all eigenvalues \u003e= 0. The operator {Q, Q_bar} has all eigenvalues \u003c= 0. This confirms H \u003e= 0 always.\n\nCONSEQUENCE: The root-of-unity q-BLM model DOES have N=2 SUSY with H \u003e= 0, just as in the real-q case. The claim that the root-of-unity regime loses the SUSY quantum mechanical interpretation is unfounded.\n\nADDITIONAL FALSE CLAIM: Child 1.4.3(ii) states for j=1 (N=3) at q=exp(2*pi*i/5), the spectrum of {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} includes negative eigenvalues. Numerically verified FALSE: for j=1, Q_q is a single cubic monomial, {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} = |c|^2 {A, A^dag} \u003e= 0 trivially.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
