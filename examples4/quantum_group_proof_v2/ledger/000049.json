The tetrahedron diagram is used only as a pedagogical exercise. The first non-melonic diagram that actually appears is the 9j/cube diagram (lines 579-622), and even that vanishes for odd j (line 610). The actual first non-vanishing non-melonic diagram is the 12j cube (lines 612-622), which has 8 vertices (not 4) and scales as N^4 * {12j} ~ j * (log j / j). Using the tetrahedron as the proxy for non-melonic diagrams in the q-deformed case is misleading because: (1) it does not appear in the model, (2) the actual non-melonic diagrams involve more complicated symbols (12j, not 6j), and (3) the scaling analysis is completely different for multi-vertex diagrams where multiple 6j-like factors may appear with different q-dependent behaviors.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
