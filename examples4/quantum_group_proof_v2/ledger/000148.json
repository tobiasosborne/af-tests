{"type":"node_validated","timestamp":"2026-02-11T20:32:34.012841357Z","node_id":"1.3.2","note":"VERIFIED WITH TWO MINOR ISSUES. Classical section (q=1): All claims cross-checked against Draft.tex. Tetrahedron scaling N^2*{6j} ~ sqrt(j) confirmed from line 572 (Ponzano-Regge). Melonic vacuum ~ NJ ~ j confirmed from line 526. The 12j cube asymptotics (lines 615-617) correctly give (log j)/j suppression: N^4 * {12j} ~ (const)*log(j) vs melonic ~ j. Tetrahedron correctly identified as pedagogical proxy (line 556 confirms non-appearance in oriented model). q-deformed section: Conditional analysis is logically sound. Case (a): Sigma_q = JN/[N]_q giving melonic vacuum ~ j^2*exp(-2j|log q|) is correct. Case (b): Sigma_q = J giving melonic vacuum ~ j is correct. The q\u003c-\u003eq^{-1} symmetry argument is mathematically rigorous. All four caveats (i)-(iv) are comprehensive and valid. Epistemic labels (ESTABLISHED vs CONJECTURAL) are accurate. Two minor issues raised: (1) case (b) vertex factor exponent should be 8j|log q| not 4j|log q| (factor-of-2 arithmetic error, doesn't affect qualitative conclusion); (2) formal dependency metadata missing for nodes 1.3.1 and 1.1.2 (textual dependency is explicit). Overall: the node represents a careful and appropriately hedged analysis."}
