However, the formal dependency metadata shows '(no dependencies declared)'. While the textual dependency is clear, the formal dependency should be declared so that the taint propagation system can properly track which nodes need re-verification if 1.3.1 or 1.1.2 change. This is a metadata/tooling issue, not a mathematical issue.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
