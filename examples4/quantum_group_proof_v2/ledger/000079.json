All 7 verification points confirmed: (1) D^BPS = 2x3^j confirmed from BLM paper line 382 (conditional on |R|=1/6 assumption). (2) ker(H_q) = ker(Q_q) cap ker(Q_q-dagger) is standard SUSY QM. (3) Q_q annihilation topological: CORRECT (weight conservation in U_q(su(2)) with undeformed Cartan). (4) Q_q-dagger annihilation NOT topological: CORRECT (BLM proof lines 1654-1703 uses sign-sector symmetry that breaks under q-deformation). (5) Witten index formula matches BLM eq WI1 line 371; q-independence is correct. (6) Unsigned D^BPS not index-protected: standard. Two non-blocking challenges: (a) primary obstacle is broken q-Regge symmetry in sign sectors, not bubble identity (minor), (b) numerical computation at small j is most accessible resolution path (note)."}
