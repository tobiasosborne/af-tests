For fixed q ≠ 1, the tetrahedron diagram involves {6j}_q ~ exp(j * Vol_hyp) while the melonic self-energy involves [2j+1]_q ~ q^{2j}/(q-q^{-1}). Both grow exponentially, and their ratio is generically NOT suppressed — it is itself exponential: exp(j * (Vol_hyp - 2 log q)). When Vol_hyp \u003e 2 log q, non-melonic diagrams DOMINATE melonic ones.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"132bf728e0b1d337a1108a88fc2d3799c4a10add98d94461abe7457095252225","created":"2026-02-11T18:44:35.964858282Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
