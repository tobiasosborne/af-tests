The quantum dimension is [2l+1]_q = sin((2l+1)*pi/r)/sin(pi/r), which is positive for all admissible l. Given a triangulation T of a closed oriented 3-manifold M, the Turaev-Viro invariant is TV_r(M) = D_r^{-2} * sum_{f: edges -\u003e {0,...,(r-2)/2}} prod_{e} [2f(e)+1]_q * prod_{t} {6j}_q(t,f), where D_r^2 = sum_{l=0}^{(r-2)/2} [2l+1]_q^2. TV_r(M) is independent of T (Turaev-Viro 1992). The Turaev-Walker theorem gives TV_r(M) = tau_r(M) * tau_r(-M) = |tau_r(M)|^2 where tau_r is the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant of M (the rigorous version of the SU(2) Chern-Simons partition function at level k = r-2). In the semiclassical limit, TV_r describes Euclidean 3D gravity with positive cosmological constant Lambda = 4*pi^2/(r-2)^2 + O((r-2)^{-4}) (Mizoguchi-Tada 1992). NOTE: TV coloring labels l = 0, 1/2, ..., (r-2)/2 are distinct from the BLM model parameter j (fixed odd integer).","new_statement":"Step 1.4.1 (Established: Turaev-Viro state sum at root of unity): Let r \u003e= 3 be an integer and set A = exp(i*pi/r), so that q = A^2 = exp(2*pi*i/r) is a primitive r-th root of unity. QUANTUM INTEGER CONVENTION: We use the quantum integer [n]_A = (A^n - A^{-n})/(A - A^{-1}) = sin(n*pi/r)/sin(pi/r). (This corresponds to [n]_q with the convention [n]_q = (q^{n/2} - q^{-n/2})/(q^{1/2} - q^{-1/2}), NOT the alternative [n]_q = (q^n - q^{-n})/(q - q^{-1}) which would give sin(2*pi*n/r)/sin(2*pi/r).) At this root of unity, U_q(su(2)) has finitely many irreducible representations labeled by l = 0, 1/2, 1, ..., (r-2)/2 (integer and half-integer spins with 2l+1 \u003c= r-1). The quantum dimension of the spin-l representation is d_l := [2l+1]_A = sin((2l+1)*pi/r)/sin(pi/r), which is strictly positive for all admissible l in {0, 1/2, ..., (r-2)/2}. TURAEV-VIRO INVARIANT: Given a triangulation T of a closed oriented 3-manifold M with vertex set V, edge set E, and tetrahedron set Tet, define the total quantum order D_r^2 = sum_{l=0}^{(r-2)/2} d_l^2 = sum_{l=0}^{(r-2)/2} [2l+1]_A^2. A coloring f: E -\u003e {0, 1/2, 1, ..., (r-2)/2} is ADMISSIBLE if for every 2-face (triangle) of T with edge labels (a,b,c): (i) the triangle inequality holds: |a-b| \u003c= c \u003c= a+b, (ii) a+b+c is an integer (parity condition), and (iii) a+b+c \u003c= r-2 (level truncation). The Turaev-Viro invariant is TV_r(M) = D_r^{-2|V|} * sum_{f admissible} prod_{e in E} d_{f(e)} * prod_{t in Tet} {6j}_q(t,f), where |V| is the number of vertices of T. The per-vertex normalization factor D_r^{-2|V|} (equivalently w^{-2|V|} with w^2 = D_r^2, following Turaev-Viro 1992, Topology 31, eq. 1.1) is essential and should not be confused with a single overall factor D_r^{-2}. The product over edges weights each edge by its quantum dimension d_{f(e)}, and {6j}_q(t,f) is the quantum 6j symbol of the tetrahedron t with the coloring f. TV_r(M) is independent of the choice of triangulation T (Turaev-Viro 1992). NOTE ON 6j CONVENTION: The standard TV formula uses the quantum 6j symbol {6j}_q without absolute-value squaring. The parent node 1.4 writes |{6j}|^2 which is non-standard; the formula given here (without squaring) is the correct one. TURAEV-WALKER THEOREM: TV_r(M) = |tau_r(M)|^2, where tau_r is the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant of M (the rigorous version of the SU(2) Chern-Simons partition function at level k_CS = r-2). SEMICLASSICAL LIMIT: In the limit r -\u003e infinity, the TV state sum recovers a discretized path integral for Euclidean 3D gravity with positive cosmological constant. Mizoguchi-Tada (1992) showed Lambda = 4*pi^2/k_{MT}^2 + O(k_{MT}^{-4}), where their parameter k_{MT} is defined by A^{2k_{MT}} = 1 (i.e., q^{k_{MT}} = 1 in their convention). With our A = exp(i*pi/r), this gives k_{MT} = r, yielding Lambda = 4*pi^2/r^2 + O(r^{-4}). NOTE: Some references express this using the Chern-Simons level k_CS = r-2, giving Lambda = 4*pi^2/(k_CS + 2)^2 + O((k_CS + 2)^{-4}), which differs from 4*pi^2/k_CS^2 at subleading order. We use the TV root-of-unity parameter r directly to avoid this ambiguity. NOTE: TV coloring labels l = 0, 1/2, ..., (r-2)/2 are distinct from the BLM model parameter j (fixed odd integer).","owner":"prover-141"}
