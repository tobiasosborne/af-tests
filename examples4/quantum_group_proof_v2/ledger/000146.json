{"type":"node_validated","timestamp":"2026-02-11T20:32:24.292111038Z","node_id":"1.3.1","note":"VERIFIED with thorough cross-checking against literature. (A) Root-of-unity regime: Belletti-Yang (J Topology 2025) correctly cited; admissibility condition j_i \u003c (r-2)/2 with r odd is correct; limit formula matches their Theorem; volume sign variability correctly noted; Costantino (Geom Topol 2007) and BDKY (J Diff Geom 2022) attributions verified. (B) Fixed real q: Taylor-Woodward (Selecta Math 2005/2006) Section 9 confirmed to state results without proof; open conjecture status correctly labeled. Minor: publication year may be 2006 not 2005 in print. (C) q\u003c-\u003eq^{-1} symmetry: [n]_q = [n]_{q^{-1}} verified by direct computation; impossibility argument for asymmetric growth rates is logically sound. (D) Regime distinction is accurate; Faddeev 1999 (math/9912078), Ponsot-Teschner 2001 (CMP 224), Teschner-Vartanov 2014 (Lett Math Phys 104) all correctly cited with accurate characterization of continuous vs finite-dimensional representations. This node was substantially improved by addressing all 4 prior challenges."}
