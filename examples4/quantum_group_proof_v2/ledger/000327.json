This is FALSE for admissible j satisfying the operative Condition B (r \u003e= 3j+2). At q = exp(2*pi*i/r), the quantum integer [n]_q = sin(n*pi/r)/sin(pi/r) is REAL for all integer n and positive r. Under Condition B, all quantum factorials [n]\\! appearing in the Racah formula have n \u003c= 3j+1 \u003c r, so sin(n*pi/r) \u003e 0 for all such n, making [n]_q \u003e 0 and hence [n]\\! \u003e 0 (a product of positive reals). The triangle coefficient Delta(j,j,j) = sqrt([j]\\!^3/[3j+1]\\!) is the square root of a positive real, hence real and positive. The full Racah formula then involves sums of ratios of positive quantum factorials multiplied by phase factors (-1)^z from the alternating sum, yielding a sum of REAL terms. Therefore the q-3j symbols at root of unity with admissible j are REAL, not complex. Consequently: (1) the premise of OP2(d) is false, (2) the question about combinatorial interpretation is based on a non-issue since all amplitudes are already real, and (3) the question about cancellations specific to complex amplitudes does not apply. The q-3j symbols become genuinely complex only for NON-admissible j (where the Racah formula involves [n]_q with n \u003e= r, giving oscillatory or zero factors), but such j are already excluded by Condition B. OP2(d) should either be deleted or rewritten to address a genuine issue (e.g., the sign structure of real root-of-unity amplitudes vs. the positive amplitudes at generic real q \u003e 0).","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
