The quantum 6j symbols become building blocks of the Turaev-Viro state sum TV_r(M) = D^{-2v} sum prod [2j_e+1]_q prod |{6j}_q|^2, a topological invariant satisfying TV_r = |tau_r|^2 (Turaev-Walker). The non-melonic corrections in this regime are controlled by topological 3D gravity (Euclidean 3D gravity with Lambda ~ 1/k^2). The limit r -\u003e infinity recovers regime I. NOTE: This regime requires q complex (|q|=1), a qualitative change from q \u003e 0 real in Parts 0-II, requiring analytic continuation.","new_statement":"PART III (Root-of-unity regime, q = exp(2*pi*i/r) -- CONJECTURAL/MIXED STATUS): This part concerns the formal specialization of q-BLM model structures to roots of unity. The mathematical content divides into three layers of decreasing rigor:\n\n(A) ESTABLISHED MATHEMATICS (Turaev-Viro/Reshetikhin-Turaev): At q = exp(2*pi*i/r), the representation theory of U_q(su(2)) truncates to finitely many irreducibles with spin labels l = 0, 1/2, 1, ..., (r-2)/2 (these are TV COLORING LABELS, not the BLM model parameter j). The quantum 6j symbols at root of unity are the building blocks of the Turaev-Viro state sum TV_r(M) = D_r^{-2} * sum_{admissible colorings} prod_{edges e} [2l_e+1]_q * prod_{tetrahedra t} |{6j}_q(t)|^2, where D_r^2 = sum_{l=0}^{(r-2)/2} [2l+1]_q^2 and the sum is over a triangulation of a closed oriented 3-manifold M (the result is triangulation-independent). The Turaev-Walker theorem states TV_r(M) = tau_r(M) * tau_r(-M) = |tau_r(M)|^2, where tau_r is the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant (a mathematically rigorous version of the SU(2) Chern-Simons partition function at level k = r-2). In the semiclassical limit, TV_r describes Euclidean 3D gravity with positive cosmological constant Lambda = 4*pi^2/(r-2)^2 + O((r-2)^{-4}) (Mizoguchi-Tada 1992, Taylor-Woodward 2005).\n\n(B) STRUCTURAL ANALOGY (BLM diagrams and GFT/Boulatov): The BLM model uses a FIXED odd integer j \u003e= 1 as its spin parameter (N = 2j+1 fermion modes). BLM Feynman diagrams involve products of quantum 3j and 6j symbols at this fixed j. The Boulatov group field theory (GFT) provides a framework where Feynman diagrams of a field theory on SU(2)^3 are dual to triangulations of 3-manifolds, and each Feynman amplitude equals the corresponding Ponzano-Regge (q=1) or Turaev-Viro (q root of unity) amplitude of the dual triangulation (Boulatov 1992, Freidel 2005). However, the BLM model is NOT a GFT: (i) BLM uses a single fixed spin j, while GFT/TV sums over ALL admissible spins; (ii) BLM diagrams are specific Feynman diagrams of a 0+1 dimensional QM, not of a field theory on a group manifold; (iii) the BLM vertex involves 3j symbols at a single j, while the Boulatov vertex involves integration over the full group. The precise map from BLM Feynman amplitudes to TV-type invariants remains AN OPEN PROBLEM. What IS established is that individual non-melonic BLM diagrams (tetrahedron, cube, etc.) involve quantum 6j and higher recoupling symbols that are the SAME algebraic objects appearing as TV weights. The structural relationship is: BLM diagrams evaluate to products of quantum recoupling symbols at fixed j, while TV state sums evaluate products of the SAME symbols summed over all admissible j \u003c= (r-2)/2.\n\n(C) CRITICAL OBSTRUCTION -- SUSY BREAKS AT ROOT OF UNITY: The N=2 SUSY structure H_q = {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} \u003e= 0 established in Part 0 (node 1.1) relies ESSENTIALLY on q \u003e 0 real, which ensures the quantum 3j symbols C^j_q(m1,m2,m3) are real. At q = exp(2*pi*i/r), the q-3j symbols are generically COMPLEX. Consequences: (i) Q_q^2 = 0 still holds (the antisymmetry of q-3j under column permutation persists at root of unity, being an algebraic identity). (ii) The naive H_q = Q_q * Q_q^bar + Q_q^bar * Q_q (with Q_q^bar = complex conjugate of coefficients) is NOT positive semi-definite because Q_q^bar is not the Fock-space adjoint of Q_q when coefficients are complex. (iii) The correct Fock-space adjoint Q_q^dagger differs from Q_q^bar, and {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} need not equal {Q_q, Q_q^bar}. Therefore, the root-of-unity regime is a QUALITATIVELY DIFFERENT model: it inherits the algebraic nilpotency Q_q^2 = 0 and the combinatorial structure of Feynman diagrams from the q \u003e 0 model, but loses the SUSY quantum mechanical interpretation (positive Hamiltonian, BPS states, Witten index). Any claims about the root-of-unity regime must be understood as statements about the FORMAL algebraic and diagrammatic structure, not about a well-defined quantum mechanical system with SUSY.\n\nLIMIT r -\u003e infinity: As r -\u003e infinity, the spin truncation (r-2)/2 -\u003e infinity recovers the full representation theory of U_q(su(2)) at q=1 (since q -\u003e 1). The TV state sum formally approaches the Ponzano-Regge sum, but the PR sum is divergent and requires regularization (the TV state sum IS the regularization). For the BLM model at fixed j, the root-of-unity obstruction (C) disappears continuously as r -\u003e infinity since q -\u003e 1 (real), recovering Part I. Whether the fixed-j BLM model can be made well-defined at root of unity (e.g., via a modified inner product or a non-SUSY Hamiltonian) is an open question.","owner":"prover-1.4"}
