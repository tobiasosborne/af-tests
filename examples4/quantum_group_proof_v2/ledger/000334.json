Two-condition structure (A: r\u003e=2j+2, B: r\u003e=3j+2) is correctly stated. Racah formula argument is sound: Delta(j,j,j) has denominator [3j+1]!, requiring r \u003e 3j+1 so r \u003e= 3j+2. Examples verified: j=1-\u003er\u003e=5, j=3-\u003er\u003e=11, j=5-\u003er\u003e=17. Condition B implies Condition A (3j+2 \u003e 2j+2 for j \u003e= 1). TV level truncation coincidence 3j \u003c= r-2 iff r \u003e= 3j+2 verified. The statement that Condition A is automatically satisfied when B holds is correct since (r-2)/3 \u003c (r-2)/2 for r \u003e= 5.\n\n(B) OP1: The open problem is well-posed. The obstacle about triangulation independence breaking when restricting spins is correctly reasoned. The Ben Geloun-Bonzom reference issue is addressed in a separate minor challenge.\n\n(C) OP2(a) BOUNDARY BEHAVIOR: CORRECT. The corrected analysis identifies [2j+2]_q = [r]_q = 0 as the genuine mechanism. The node explicitly notes this boundary j = (r-2)/2 is OUTSIDE the BLM admissible range and frames OP2(a) as concerning a 'hypothetical extension.' This is mathematically honest and clear.\n\n(C) OP2(b) SPECTRAL GAP: CORRECT. Now references '3j+2' as the admissibility bound, consistent with the v5 amendment.\n\n(C) OP2(c) BPS DEGENERACY: ACCEPTABLE. The Witten index claim is standard SUSY lore correctly applied. For finite-dimensional systems the index is robust. The node appropriately uses 'should be' language for the root-of-unity specialization.\n\n(D) OP3: The coincidence of BLM and TV (j,j,j) admissibility is correctly identified. Regime II is correctly dismissed as vacuous for BLM. The two caveats (single-coloring is not triangulation-independent; BLM sums over diagram topologies while TV sums over triangulations) are mathematically sound observations.\n\n(E) L1: CORRECT. References classical q=1 theory. Both bounds becoming vacuous as r -\u003e infinity correctly stated.\n\n(E) L2: CORRECT. PR divergence correctly described. Cosmological constant formula Lambda = 4*pi^2/(r-2)^2 matches standard conventions (k = r-2).\n\n(E) L3: CORRECT. SUSY described as always present, not needing recovery. The q-\u003e1 limit recovers algebraic simplifications (reality of coefficients, absence of truncation).\n\n(F) ERRATA: Both errata (original on SUSY preservation, v5 on admissibility bound) are accurate and properly documented.\n\n(G) CONSISTENCY: Node is consistent with parent 1.4.4 (same r \u003e= 3j+2 bound, same two-condition structure), with validated sibling 1.4.3 (same Condition B), and with grandparent 1.4 (which was amended to the same bounds).\n\nBLOCKING ISSUE: One major challenge (OP2(d) q-3j symbol reality) blocks acceptance.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
