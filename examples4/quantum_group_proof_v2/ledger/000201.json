The root node's statement is a synthesis of these children, and its truth value depends on their individual correctness. In particular, the root cannot be validated while children 1.4, 1.4.3, and 1.4.4 remain pending with unresolved critical challenges. The dependency chain should be made explicit so that taint propagation correctly tracks the relationship between the root and its unresolved children.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
