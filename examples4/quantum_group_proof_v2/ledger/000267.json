This is imprecise. As r -\u003e infinity, q = exp(2*pi*i/r) -\u003e 1, and what is recovered is the representation theory of U_q(su(2)) at q = 1, which is the classical representation theory of su(2) (or equivalently SU(2)). The phrase 'generic q' typically means q not a root of unity and q \\!= 0, and the representation theory at generic q differs from q = 1 (e.g., quantum dimensions [2l+1]_q differ from 2l+1 at generic q \\!= 1). The correct statement is: in the limit r -\u003e infinity, the truncation disappears and the q-deformed quantities converge to their q=1 classical values. The node correctly says this elsewhere (e.g., in L3), but the specific phrase in L1 is misleading.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
