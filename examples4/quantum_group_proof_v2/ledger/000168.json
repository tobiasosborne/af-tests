While these are correct references for the Boulatov GFT and its relation to PR amplitudes respectively, the proof tree should note that these references come from the external literature on group field theory, not from the BLM paper itself. This matters because the BLM paper does not discuss the GFT connection at all -- the entire structural analogy is constructed by the proof tree authors.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
