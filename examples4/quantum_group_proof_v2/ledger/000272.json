The original Turaev-Viro (1992) formula, eq. (1.1), includes edge weights Delta_l = (-1)^{2l} * [2l+1]_A, not just [2l+1]_A. For integer labels l, (-1)^{2l} = 1, so the formulas agree. For half-integer labels l, (-1)^{2l} = -1, introducing a sign difference.\n\nSince the TV coloring labels include half-integers (l = 0, 1/2, 1, ..., (r-2)/2), this sign affects the state sum. The node's formula without the (-1)^{2l} factor corresponds to a different convention for the 6j symbols (one that absorbs the signs into the definition of the 6j symbol via Theta-net normalizations).\n\nThis is a convention choice, not a mathematical error, but the node should either:\n(a) Include the (-1)^{2l} factor explicitly, or\n(b) State which convention for the 6j symbol is being used and confirm that it absorbs these signs.\n\nThis is a note, not a blocking issue, because the node's main purpose is not to precisely define the TV invariant but to establish the structural analogy with BLM. The formula is correct in the stated convention.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
