Derivation (Delta(j,j,j) denominator contains [3j+1]!, [n]_q = 0 iff r|n, need r \u003e 3j+1) is sound. Examples (j=1-\u003er\u003e=5, j=3-\u003er\u003e=11, j=5-\u003er\u003e=17) verified. Counterexample (j=3, r=9) is valid. No leakage of old r \u003e= 2j+3 bound.\n\n(2) OP1: Well-posed. Three required steps correctly identified. Triangulation-independence obstacle is genuine. Fermionic GFT reference ('Geloun-Bonzom') is vague but this is a previously-noted minor bibliographic issue.\n\n(3) OP2(a) BOUNDARY ANALYSIS: CORRECT in substance. The false equation [2j+1]_q = [r-1]_q at j=(r-2)/3 from previous versions has been FIXED -- now correctly states [2j+1]_q = [(2r-1)/3]_q. The false claim about 1/[2j+1]_q diverging at j=(r-2)/2 has been FIXED -- now correctly identifies [2j+2]_q = [r]_q = 0 as the mechanism and explicitly notes j=(r-2)/2 is outside BLM admissibility. ONE MINOR ERROR: numerical value [7]_q ≈ 1.563 should be ≈ 3.229 (filed separately as ch-aa76f96055ed26d1).\n\n(4) OP2(b) SPECTRAL GAP: CORRECT. References admissibility bound 3j+2 (not old 2j+3). Well-posed question.\n\n(5) OP2(c) BPS DEGENERACY: CORRECT. Standard SUSY lore appropriately applied.\n\n(6) OP2(d) PERTURBATIVE EXPANSION (v7 FIX): CORRECT. The reality argument is sound: [n]_q = sin(n*pi/r)/sin(pi/r) is real; under Condition B, all n satisfy 1 \u003c= n \u003c= 3j+1 \u003c r so sin(n*pi/r) \u003e 0 making [n]_q positive real; quantum factorials are products of positive reals; Delta(j,j,j) = sqrt(positive) is real; Racah sum produces real values. The three sub-questions (weight modification, truncation effects, sign structure) are genuine and well-posed. V7 FIX IS CORRECT.\n\n(7) OP3: CORRECT. TV admissibility coincidence with Racah bound is properly identified. Regime II correctly characterized as vacuous for BLM. Caveats (I) and (II) are mathematically sound.\n\n(8) L1: CORRECT. No 'generic q' language. References classical q=1 values. Both bounds becoming vacuous as r -\u003e infinity.\n\n(9) L2: CORRECT. PR divergence properly described. Cosmological constant formula Lambda = 4*pi^2/(r-2)^2 with k = r-2 matches standard TV conventions. PR formula includes (-1)^{2l} edge factor.\n\n(10) L3: CORRECT in substance. Minor residual tension with OP2(d) on 'reality of coefficients' language (filed separately as ch-60b08cda85732b25).\n\n(11) ERRATA: Both errata (original SUSY correction, v7 OP2(d) reality correction) are accurate and well-documented.\n\n(12) CONSISTENCY: Node is consistent with parent 1.4 (same r \u003e= 3j+2 bound, same SUSY preservation claim, same boundary analysis at C5). Node is consistent with child 1.4.4.1 (which has essentially the same content with more detailed phrasing). Node is consistent with sibling 1.4.3 (same Condition B).\n\n(13) PREVIOUSLY CHALLENGED ITEMS -- STATUS CHECK:\n- Old r \u003e= 2j+3 bound: FIXED everywhere. No leakage detected.\n- False [2j+1]_q = [r-1]_q equation: FIXED.\n- False 1/[2j+1]_q divergence claim: FIXED.\n- 'Generic q' in L1: FIXED.\n- OP2(d) complex claim: FIXED (v7).\n- Regime II vacuity: Explicitly addressed.\n- Dependencies not formally declared: Acknowledged as CLI limitation with textual declaration.\n\nBLOCKING ISSUES: NONE. The two challenges filed (ch-aa76f96055ed26d1, ch-60b08cda85732b25) are both non-blocking (minor/note severity). The node is mathematically sound after the v7 amendment.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
