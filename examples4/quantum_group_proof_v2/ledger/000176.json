These are inconsistent: the child omits the absolute value squared on the 6j symbol while the parent includes it. The standard TV formula does NOT square the 6j symbol; the parent's version appears to be the non-standard one. However, the inconsistency between parent and child should be resolved.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
