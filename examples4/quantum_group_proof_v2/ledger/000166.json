The original BLM paper (Biggs-Lin-Maldacena) works only at q=1 (standard SU(2) 3j symbols), where the cube diagram gives the 12j symbol of the second kind (paper equation 12jasmtot, line 615). The extension to quantum 12j symbols at generic q is part of the conjectured q-deformation, not an established result. The node should clarify that '{12j}_q' refers to the expected quantum analog under the q-deformation conjecture, not a proven fact.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
