{"type":"node_validated","timestamp":"2026-02-11T20:41:27.037419699Z","node_id":"1.4.2","note":"VERIFIED with 6 minor/note challenges filed. Core mathematical content is correct: (1) Boulatov GFT description (phi on SU(2)^3, diagonal invariance, tetrahedral interaction) is accurate per Boulatov 1992. (2) Feynman diagram = PR amplitude of dual triangulation is a well-established result. (3) The three BLM-Boulatov structural differences are correctly identified and accurately described: single fixed j vs spin sum, 0+1d QM vs group manifold field theory, Hamiltonian vs partition function. (4) The open problem qualification is properly stated. (5) The shared algebraic building blocks (3j at vertices, 6j in tetrahedron, 12j in cube) are confirmed by the BLM paper (lines 569, 612). Minor issues filed: imprecise statement about quantum group replacement producing TV amplitudes (needs more careful construction), quantum 12j notation presupposes the q-deformation conjecture, tetrahedral vertex description conflates action vertex with diagram topology, BLM paper does not cite Boulatov/Freidel, and H_q notation conflates original and q-deformed model. No critical or major errors found."}
