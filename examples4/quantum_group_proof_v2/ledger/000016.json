The U_q(su(2)) coproduct is non-cocommutative: Delta(J_q^+) = J_q^+ ⊗ K + 1 ⊗ J_q^+, introducing position-dependent q^m factors via K = q^{J_q^3}. This is incompatible with ordinary fermion exchange. For Q_q to be a true U_q(su(2)) scalar, one would need BRAIDED fermions (q-fermions with exchange governed by the R-matrix). Open question: does a consistent q-BLM model require q-deformed fermion statistics, and if so, how does this affect the Fock space, H_q, and the BPS structure?
