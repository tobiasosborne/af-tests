All mathematical claims checked against standard references.\n\n(1) COPRODUCT FORMULA: The node states Delta(J_q^+) = J_q^+ ⊗ K + 1 ⊗ J_q^+. This uses one of several valid conventions. The most common mathematical convention (Kassel, Arun Ram) is Delta(E) = E ⊗ 1 + K ⊗ E, while some physics references use the node's convention Delta(E) = E ⊗ K + 1 ⊗ E (opposite/dual convention). BOTH are legitimate; they differ by composing with the coopposite. The key property — non-cocommutativity of Delta — holds in all conventions. MINOR NOTE: the node should ideally specify which convention is intended.\n\n(2) K = q^{J_q^3}: CORRECT. Standard physics identification. In math conventions K = q^{H/2} where H = 2J^3, yielding K|m\u003e = q^m|m\u003e. Verified against Etingof-Semenyakin (CMSA) and Arun Ram lecture notes.\n\n(3) NON-COCOMMUTATIVITY vs FERMION EXCHANGE: CORRECT and well-established. In a quasitriangular Hopf algebra, the correct antisymmetrizer uses the braiding c = tau o R, not naive flip tau. Ordinary antisymmetric subspace is NOT a U_q-submodule for q != 1. Standard material (Kassel Ch. 8, Majid Ch. 9-10).\n\n(4) BRAIDED FERMIONS: CORRECTLY identified. Key refs: Majid q-alg/9512006, Fiore hep-th/9611144, Woronowicz q-alg/9512008.\n\n(5) OPEN QUESTION: VERIFIED genuinely open. Abstract braided fermion constructions exist but specific q-BLM application NOT in literature. BLM paper (2601.08908) does not discuss quantum group deformations.\n\n(6) V1 PROVENANCE: VERIFIED against v1 ledger 000042.json.\n\nMINOR CAVEATS (non-blocking): (a) Coproduct convention should be specified. (b) Incompatibility statement could be more precise about degree of non-covariance. (c) Intertwiners in the braided tensor category is slightly informal."}
