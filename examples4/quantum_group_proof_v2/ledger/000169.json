The original BLM model (Biggs-Lin-Maldacena) uses standard SU(2) Wigner 3j symbols, i.e. q=1. It defines H = {Q, Q^dagger} with no q-parameter (paper eq. HamFi, line 261). The q-deformed version H_q = {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} is the conjectured model introduced by the proof tree itself (node 1.1). While the structural analogy paragraph can reasonably use the q-deformed notation (since the proof tree is about the q-BLM model), this conflation should be explicitly acknowledged: the BLM paper's Feynman diagrams involve standard 3j/6j symbols, and the q-deformed versions are the proof tree's extension.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
