The node states that 'the triangle inequality (j,j,j) is trivially satisfied, and 3j is an integer for integer j' as though this establishes that the single coloring (j,j,j) is admissible in TV. However, the node omits the THIRD admissibility condition from the parent node 1.4: for TV admissibility, a+b+c \u003c= r-2 (level truncation). For the coloring (j,j,j), this requires 3j \u003c= r-2, i.e., j \u003c= (r-2)/3. But the BLM admissibility bound is j \u003c= (r-2)/2, which is WEAKER. For (r-2)/3 \u003c j \u003c= (r-2)/2, the coloring (j,j,j) is NOT admissible in the TV sense because 3j \u003e r-2. Concrete example: r = 9, j = 3 (odd integer, satisfies j \u003c= (r-2)/2 = 3.5). Then 3j = 9 \u003e r-2 = 7, so (3,3,3) is NOT a TV-admissible coloring. Therefore the 'single-coloring sector' interpretation of OP3 fails for the largest admissible spins in BLM. The node should state that the single-coloring interpretation is only consistent when j \u003c= (r-2)/3, which is a stricter bound than the BLM admissibility j \u003c= (r-2)/2. This gap undermines the conjectured BLM-to-TV single-coloring correspondence for roughly the top third of the admissible BLM spin range.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
