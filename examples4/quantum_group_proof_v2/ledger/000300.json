{"type":"challenge_raised","timestamp":"2026-02-12T12:55:40.641771335Z","challenge_id":"ch-c32ac6a047fcb972","node_id":"1.4.3","target":"statement","reason":"VERIFICATION RECORD -- ALL MAJOR CLAIMS CONFIRMED CORRECT: Independent verification of each claim in node 1.4.3:\n\n(i) NILPOTENCY Q_q^2 = 0: CORRECT. The conclusion holds for all admissible j at root of unity. The underlying algebraic identity (from U_q(su(2)) recoupling theory) is valid for all q where the 3j symbols are well-defined. Minor imprecision in the justification noted in separate challenge ch-4c977f1e7fc8597c.\n\n(ii) PSD {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} \u003e= 0: CORRECT AND TAUTOLOGICAL. The norm argument is ironclad. The erratum correctly identifies the original error. Sign computation verified: for cubic supercharge, (ABC)^dagger = C^dag B^dag A^dag, reversing 3 anticommuting operators requires 3(3-1)/2 = 3 transpositions, giving (-1)^3 = -1. Hence Q^dagger = -Q^bar, and {Q,Q^dagger} = -{Q,Q^bar} \u003e= 0. The j=1 counterexample refutation is correct: for N=3 there is exactly one cubic monomial, so {Q,Q^dagger} = |c|^2 {A,A^dagger} \u003e= 0 trivially.\n\n(iii) ADMISSIBILITY BOUND r \u003e= 3j+2: CORRECT. Verified against the standard Racah formula. The triangle coefficient Delta(j,j,j) = [j]!^3 / [3j+1]! (confirmed via Wolfram MathWorld). The denominator [3j+1]_q! requires [n]_q != 0 for n = 1,...,3j+1, hence r \u003e 3j+1, i.e., r \u003e= 3j+2. Condition B (r \u003e= 3j+2) is strictly stronger than Condition A (r \u003e= 2j+2) for all j \u003e= 1 since 3j+2 \u003e 2j+2 iff j \u003e 0. Concrete examples verified: j=1-\u003er\u003e=5, j=3-\u003er\u003e=11, j=5-\u003er\u003e=17.\n\n(iii-b) BOUNDARY BEHAVIOR: CORRECT. [r-1]_q = sin((r-1)pi/r)/sin(pi/r) = sin(pi/r)/sin(pi/r) = 1 for all r \u003e= 3. No parity dependence. The genuine boundary issue [2j+2]_q = [r]_q = 0 lies outside the Racah region for j \u003e= 1 (verified: j = (r-2)/2 implies r \u003c 3j+2 = (3r-2)/2 for r \u003e= 3).\n\n(iii-c) FINITE TRUNCATION: CORRECT. All j_max values verified: r=5-\u003e1, r=11-\u003e3, r=17-\u003e5, r=20-\u003e5, r=23-\u003e7.\n\nCONCLUSION: Logically follows from (i)+(ii)+(iii). No internal contradictions found. Parent node inconsistency correctly identified (parent says r\u003e=2j+3, correct bound is r\u003e=3j+2). The REMARK about possible cancellations for specific (j,r) pairs is mathematically sound.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
