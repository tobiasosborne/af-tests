However, OP2(d) (corrected in v7) establishes that q-3j symbols are ALREADY REAL for admissible j at root of unity. If the coefficients are already real at root of unity (which OP2(d) proves correctly), then 'reality of all coefficients' is not something that needs to be 'recovered' in the q-\u003e1 limit -- it is already present. L3 should say something like 'recovery of classical numerical values of coefficients and absence of truncation constraints' rather than 'reality of all coefficients.' This is a residual inconsistency from the v7 amendment, which corrected OP2(d) but did not update L3 to match.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
