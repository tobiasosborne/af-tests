For fixed q ≠ 1, the tetrahedron diagram involves {6j}_q ~ exp(j * Vol_hyp) while the melonic self-energy involves [2j+1]_q ~ q^{2j}/(q-q^{-1}). Both grow exponentially, and their ratio is generically NOT suppressed — it is itself exponential: exp(j * (Vol_hyp - 2 log q)). When Vol_hyp \u003e 2 log q, non-melonic diagrams DOMINATE melonic ones.","new_statement":"Step 1.3.2 (Non-melonic scaling analysis — classical established, q-deformed conjectural):\n\nCLASSICAL (q=1, ESTABLISHED): The tetrahedron diagram, while not appearing in the oriented BLM model (Draft.tex line 556), serves as a pedagogical proxy: N^2 * {6j} ~ j^{1/2} vs melonic vacuum ~ NJ ~ j, giving 1/sqrt(j) suppression. The ACTUAL first non-melonic diagram is the 8-vertex cube (12j symbol of the second kind, Draft.tex lines 612-622). Its asymptotics (Garoufalidis et al.) give N^4 * {12j}_{(II)} ~ j * ((log j)/j + O(1/j)), so the first non-melonic correction is suppressed by (log j)/j relative to the melonic vacuum. This establishes melonic dominance at q=1.\n\nq-DEFORMED (q \u003e 0, q != 1, CONJECTURAL — depends on node 1.3.1): The following analysis is conditional on the conjectural exponential asymptotics of quantum 6j symbols for fixed real q (node 1.3.1). The cited references (Taylor-Woodward 2005, Costantino 2007, Belletti-Yang 2025) establish exponential asymptotics only at roots of unity; the extension to fixed real q \u003e 0 remains an open conjecture. Additionally, the q \u003c-\u003e q^{-1} symmetry of quantum 6j symbols (since [n]_q is invariant under q -\u003e q^{-1}) implies that {6j}_q = {6j}_{q^{-1}}, so the asymptotic behavior is symmetric between q \u003e 1 and 0 \u003c q \u003c 1.\n\nCONDITIONAL SCALING ANALYSIS: Assuming {6j}_q has exponential growth |{6j}_q| ~ exp(j * V(q)) with V(q) = V(q^{-1}) \u003e 0 (conjectural), the non-melonic diagram scaling depends critically on the vertex normalization (node 1.1.2):\n\n(a) Classical normalization sqrt(2JN): The cube diagram involves V_cube(q) vertex factors and 6j-type symbols. The melonic vacuum ~ N * Sigma_q = N * JN/[N]_q ~ j^2 * exp(-2j|log q|) for q != 1, which DECAYS exponentially. If individual non-melonic diagrams grow exponentially while melonic diagrams decay, the ratio diverges exponentially — suggesting breakdown of melonic dominance.\n\n(b) q-adapted normalization sqrt(2J[N]_q): Sigma_q = J, so melonic vacuum ~ NJ ~ j (polynomial, as at q=1). The cube diagram acquires vertex factors involving [N]_q that grow as exp(4j|log q|) (for 8 vertices each contributing [N]_q^{1/2}). Combined with the conjectural exponential 6j growth, non-melonic diagrams would grow exponentially while melonic ones grow polynomially.\n\nIn both cases, IF the quantum 6j (or 12j) symbol grows exponentially for fixed real q, then the polynomial suppression mechanism of classical melonic dominance fails. However, this conditional conclusion has significant caveats:\n\n(i) The 12j symbol asymptotics for q != 1 are unknown — they involve more complex recoupling than a single 6j symbol and may not exhibit simple exponential behavior.\n(ii) Sub-exponential prefactors, oscillatory phases, and sign cancellations (analogous to the cos(...) in the classical Ponzano-Regge formula) could modify the effective contribution.\n(iii) Combinatorial multiplicity of melonic vs non-melonic diagrams at a given loop order is not accounted for — the melonic counting advantage could compensate for individual diagram growth.\n(iv) The analysis treats individual diagram contributions; the full partition function involves sums over spins where cancellations may restore effective melonic dominance.\n\nCONCLUSION: At q=1, melonic dominance is established with (log j)/j suppression of the leading non-melonic correction. For q != 1, breakdown of melonic dominance is a CONJECTURE contingent on (1) the unproven exponential asymptotics of quantum recoupling symbols for fixed real q, and (2) the assumption that sub-exponential corrections, signs, and combinatorics do not restore effective suppression. The qualitative mechanism — exponential vs polynomial growth — is physically compelling but not mathematically proven.","owner":"prover-1.3.2"}
