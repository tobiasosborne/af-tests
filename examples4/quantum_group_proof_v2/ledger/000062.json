The exponential asymptotics |{6j}_q| ~ exp(j * Vol_hyp) for fixed real q is an UNPROVEN CONJECTURE.\n- ch-3b488dcc873fb8e6: q \u003c-\u003e q^{-1} symmetry of quantum 6j symbols contradicts the claimed Vol_hyp \u003e 0 for q \u003e 1 / Vol_hyp \u003c 0 for q \u003c 1 dichotomy — this is MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE.\n- ch-7226f05f961ab41f: The two asymptotic regimes (fixed q real vs root-of-unity q -\u003e 1) are conflated.\n\nNODE 1.3.2 (2 critical/3 major challenges):\n- ch-a62f63a13e267b0a: Entire argument depends on unproven node 1.3.1.\n- ch-1c5e418a9571232b: The formula exp(j*(Vol_hyp - 2 log q)) is INCORRECT under both vertex normalization conventions.\n- ch-728b641d0b9048e3: The tetrahedron diagram does not even appear in the BLM model.\n- ch-177f06333474b04e: Dominance claim ignores prefactors, combinatorial multiplicities, and signs.\n\nWithout the premise that non-melonic asymptotics change from polynomial to exponential at q=1, node 1.3.3's conclusion about a \"phase transition\" has no content. The node should declare explicit dependencies on 1.3.1 and 1.3.2, and since both are critically challenged, 1.3.3 inherits their failures.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
