Mizoguchi-Tada (1992) give Lambda = 4*pi^2/k^2 + O(k^{-4}) where q^{2k}=1 (their convention). The node claims Lambda = 4*pi^2/(r-2)^2 + O((r-2)^{-4}) using r from q = exp(2*pi*i/r). This implicitly identifies the Mizoguchi-Tada parameter k with the Chern-Simons level r-2, but in the Mizoguchi-Tada convention k is the ROOT OF UNITY ORDER (half of it: q^{2k}=1, so q is a primitive 2k-th root), which corresponds to r or r/2 depending on convention, NOT to r-2. If we set A = exp(i*pi/r) (TV convention) and identify Mizoguchi-Tada's q with A, then their 2k = 2r gives k = r, and Lambda = 4*pi^2/r^2. The identification k = r-2 (Chern-Simons level) in the cosmological constant formula needs explicit justification or is likely an error.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
