However, the parent node 1.4 states the equivalent condition as 'r \u003e= 2j+3 for the integer case' (equivalently j \u003c= (r-3)/2), and gives concrete examples: 'j=1 requires r \u003e= 5; j=3 requires r \u003e= 9; j=5 requires r \u003e= 13.' These examples match the parent's bound r \u003e= 2j+3, NOT the child's bound j \u003c= (r-2)/2. Specifically: for j=1, the child's bound gives r \u003e= 4, but the parent says r \u003e= 5; for j=3, the child's bound gives r \u003e= 8, but the parent says r \u003e= 9. The two nodes are stating different bounds. Moreover, NEITHER bound may be the correct one for the quantum 3j symbol with all three spins equal to j. The Racah formula for the 3j symbol (j,j,j;m1,m2,m3) involves quantum factorials up to [3j+1]\\! (from the numerator factor [j1+j2+j3+1]\\! = [3j+1]\\!), and the denominator involves factorials up to [2j]\\!. The LEVEL TRUNCATION condition from the TV admissibility requires j+j+j = 3j \u003c= r-2, giving j \u003c= (r-2)/3 and r \u003e= 3j+2. For j=1 this gives r \u003e= 5, for j=3 this gives r \u003e= 11, for j=5 this gives r \u003e= 17. This third bound is even stricter and disagrees with both the node and the parent. The node must clarify WHICH quantum-algebraic condition determines the exact admissibility bound and resolve the inconsistency with the parent node.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
