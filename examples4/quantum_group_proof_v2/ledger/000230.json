The mathematical content divides into three layers of decreasing rigor:\n\n(A) ESTABLISHED MATHEMATICS (Turaev-Viro/Reshetikhin-Turaev): At q = exp(2*pi*i/r), the representation theory of U_q(su(2)) truncates to finitely many irreducibles with spin labels l = 0, 1/2, 1, ..., (r-2)/2 (these are TV COLORING LABELS, not the BLM model parameter j). The quantum 6j symbols at root of unity are the building blocks of the Turaev-Viro state sum TV_r(M) = D_r^{-2} * sum_{admissible colorings} prod_{edges e} [2l_e+1]_q * prod_{tetrahedra t} |{6j}_q(t)|^2, where D_r^2 = sum_{l=0}^{(r-2)/2} [2l+1]_q^2 and the sum is over a triangulation of a closed oriented 3-manifold M (the result is triangulation-independent). The Turaev-Walker theorem states TV_r(M) = tau_r(M) * tau_r(-M) = |tau_r(M)|^2, where tau_r is the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant (a mathematically rigorous version of the SU(2) Chern-Simons partition function at level k = r-2). In the semiclassical limit, TV_r describes Euclidean 3D gravity with positive cosmological constant Lambda = 4*pi^2/(r-2)^2 + O((r-2)^{-4}) (Mizoguchi-Tada 1992, Taylor-Woodward 2005).\n\n(B) STRUCTURAL ANALOGY (BLM diagrams and GFT/Boulatov): The BLM model uses a FIXED odd integer j \u003e= 1 as its spin parameter (N = 2j+1 fermion modes). BLM Feynman diagrams involve products of quantum 3j and 6j symbols at this fixed j. The Boulatov group field theory (GFT) provides a framework where Feynman diagrams of a field theory on SU(2)^3 are dual to triangulations of 3-manifolds, and each Feynman amplitude equals the corresponding Ponzano-Regge (q=1) or Turaev-Viro (q root of unity) amplitude of the dual triangulation (Boulatov 1992, Freidel 2005). However, the BLM model is NOT a GFT: (i) BLM uses a single fixed spin j, while GFT/TV sums over ALL admissible spins; (ii) BLM diagrams are specific Feynman diagrams of a 0+1 dimensional QM, not of a field theory on a group manifold; (iii) the BLM vertex involves 3j symbols at a single j, while the Boulatov vertex involves integration over the full group. The precise map from BLM Feynman amplitudes to TV-type invariants remains AN OPEN PROBLEM. What IS established is that individual non-melonic BLM diagrams (tetrahedron, cube, etc.) involve quantum 6j and higher recoupling symbols that are the SAME algebraic objects appearing as TV weights. The structural relationship is: BLM diagrams evaluate to products of quantum recoupling symbols at fixed j, while TV state sums evaluate products of the SAME symbols summed over all admissible j \u003c= (r-2)/2.\n\n(C) CRITICAL OBSTRUCTION -- SUSY BREAKS AT ROOT OF UNITY: The N=2 SUSY structure H_q = {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} \u003e= 0 established in Part 0 (node 1.1) relies ESSENTIALLY on q \u003e 0 real, which ensures the quantum 3j symbols C^j_q(m1,m2,m3) are real. At q = exp(2*pi*i/r), the q-3j symbols are generically COMPLEX. Consequences: (i) Q_q^2 = 0 still holds (the antisymmetry of q-3j under column permutation persists at root of unity, being an algebraic identity). (ii) The naive H_q = Q_q * Q_q^bar + Q_q^bar * Q_q (with Q_q^bar = complex conjugate of coefficients) is NOT positive semi-definite because Q_q^bar is not the Fock-space adjoint of Q_q when coefficients are complex. (iii) The correct Fock-space adjoint Q_q^dagger differs from Q_q^bar, and {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} need not equal {Q_q, Q_q^bar}. Therefore, the root-of-unity regime is a QUALITATIVELY DIFFERENT model: it inherits the algebraic nilpotency Q_q^2 = 0 and the combinatorial structure of Feynman diagrams from the q \u003e 0 model, but loses the SUSY quantum mechanical interpretation (positive Hamiltonian, BPS states, Witten index). Any claims about the root-of-unity regime must be understood as statements about the FORMAL algebraic and diagrammatic structure, not about a well-defined quantum mechanical system with SUSY.\n\nLIMIT r -\u003e infinity: As r -\u003e infinity, the spin truncation (r-2)/2 -\u003e infinity recovers the full representation theory of U_q(su(2)) at q=1 (since q -\u003e 1). The TV state sum formally approaches the Ponzano-Regge sum, but the PR sum is divergent and requires regularization (the TV state sum IS the regularization). For the BLM model at fixed j, the root-of-unity obstruction (C) disappears continuously as r -\u003e infinity since q -\u003e 1 (real), recovering Part I. Whether the fixed-j BLM model can be made well-defined at root of unity (e.g., via a modified inner product or a non-SUSY Hamiltonian) is an open question.","new_statement":"PART III (Root-of-unity regime, q = exp(2*pi*i/r) -- MIXED STATUS): This part concerns the formal specialization of q-BLM model structures to roots of unity. The mathematical content divides into three layers of decreasing rigor:\n\n(A) ESTABLISHED MATHEMATICS (Turaev-Viro/Reshetikhin-Turaev): At q = exp(2*pi*i/r) (equivalently A = exp(i*pi/r), q = A^2), the representation theory of U_q(su(2)) truncates to finitely many irreducible representations with spin labels l = 0, 1/2, 1, ..., (r-2)/2 (these are TV COLORING LABELS, not the BLM model parameter j). QUANTUM INTEGER CONVENTION: We use [n]_A = (A^n - A^{-n})/(A - A^{-1}) = sin(n*pi/r)/sin(pi/r), equivalently [n]_q = (q^{n/2} - q^{-n/2})/(q^{1/2} - q^{-1/2}). The quantum dimension of the spin-l representation is d_l = [2l+1]_A = sin((2l+1)*pi/r)/sin(pi/r), which is strictly positive for all admissible l in {0, 1/2, ..., (r-2)/2}. A coloring f: E -\u003e {0, 1/2, ..., (r-2)/2} of edges of a triangulation is ADMISSIBLE if for every 2-face (triangle) with edge labels (a,b,c): (i) triangle inequality |a-b| \u003c= c \u003c= a+b, (ii) a+b+c is an integer, and (iii) a+b+c \u003c= r-2 (level truncation). The Turaev-Viro invariant of a closed oriented 3-manifold M with triangulation T having vertex set V, edge set E, and tetrahedron set Tet is: TV_r(M) = D_r^{-2|V|} * sum_{f admissible} prod_{e in E} d_{f(e)} * prod_{t in Tet} {6j}_q(t,f), where |V| is the number of vertices, D_r^2 = sum_{l=0}^{(r-2)/2} d_l^2 = sum_{l=0}^{(r-2)/2} [2l+1]_A^2, and {6j}_q(t,f) is the quantum 6j symbol of tetrahedron t with coloring f (WITHOUT absolute-value squaring; the standard TV formula uses {6j}_q directly). The per-vertex normalization D_r^{-2|V|} follows Turaev-Viro 1992, Topology 31, eq. (1.1). TV_r(M) is independent of the triangulation T. The Turaev-Walker theorem states TV_r(M) = |tau_r(M)|^2, where tau_r is the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant (the mathematically rigorous version of the SU(2) Chern-Simons partition function at level k_CS = r-2). SEMICLASSICAL LIMIT: In the limit r -\u003e infinity, the TV state sum recovers a discretized path integral for Euclidean 3D gravity with positive cosmological constant Lambda = 4*pi^2/r^2 + O(r^{-4}) (using k_MT = r from the Mizoguchi-Tada 1992 convention where A^{2k_MT} = 1; equivalently Lambda = 4*pi^2/(k_CS+2)^2 + O((k_CS+2)^{-4}) using the Chern-Simons level k_CS = r-2). See also Taylor-Woodward 2005.\n\n(B) STRUCTURAL ANALOGY (BLM diagrams and GFT/Boulatov): The BLM model uses a FIXED odd integer j \u003e= 1 as its spin parameter (N = 2j+1 fermion modes). BLM Feynman diagrams involve products of quantum 3j and 6j symbols at this fixed j. The Boulatov group field theory (GFT) provides a framework where Feynman diagrams of a field theory on SU(2)^3 are dual to triangulations of 3-manifolds, and each Feynman amplitude equals the corresponding Ponzano-Regge (q=1) or Turaev-Viro (q root of unity) amplitude of the dual triangulation (Boulatov 1992, Freidel 2005). However, the BLM model is NOT a GFT: (i) BLM uses a single fixed spin j, while GFT/TV sums over ALL admissible spins; (ii) BLM diagrams are specific Feynman diagrams of a 0+1 dimensional QM, not of a field theory on a group manifold; (iii) the BLM vertex involves 3j symbols at a single j, while the Boulatov vertex involves integration over the full group. The precise map from BLM Feynman amplitudes to TV-type invariants remains AN OPEN PROBLEM. What IS established is that individual non-melonic BLM diagrams (tetrahedron, cube, etc.) involve quantum 6j and higher recoupling symbols that are the SAME algebraic objects appearing as TV weights. The structural relationship is: BLM diagrams evaluate to products of quantum recoupling symbols at fixed j, while TV state sums evaluate products of the SAME symbols summed over all admissible j \u003c= (r-2)/2.\n\n(C) SUSY AT ROOT OF UNITY -- PRESERVED WITH CONSTRAINTS: The N=2 SUSY structure of the q-BLM model is PRESERVED at root of unity, subject to the admissibility constraint on j. We establish:\n\n(C1) ADMISSIBILITY CONSTRAINT: At q = exp(2*pi*i/r), the BLM model parameter j must satisfy j \u003c= (r-2)/2 (equivalently r \u003e= 2j+3 for the integer case). This is NECESSARY for the q-3j symbols C^j_q(m1,m2,m3) to be well-defined: for j exceeding this bound, the Racah formula for the 3j symbols involves quantum factorials [n]_q! with n \u003e= r, and since [r]_q = 0, these expressions have zero denominators. Concretely: j=1 requires r \u003e= 5; j=3 requires r \u003e= 9; j=5 requires r \u003e= 13.\n\n(C2) NILPOTENCY: Q_q^2 = 0 holds at root of unity. This uses only the total antisymmetry of the q-3j symbols (an algebraic identity valid for all q, not depending on reality of coefficients) combined with Grassmann anticommutation of fermions.\n\n(C3) POSITIVE SEMI-DEFINITENESS: {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} \u003e= 0 holds at root of unity, just as for q \u003e 0 real. This is a TAUTOLOGICAL consequence of the Hilbert space adjoint: for ANY operator Q on ANY Hilbert space, \u003cv|{Q,Q^dagger}|v\u003e = ||Q^dagger v||^2 + ||Qv||^2 \u003e= 0. This holds regardless of whether Q has real or complex matrix elements. ERRATUM: The original formulation of this node (Section C) claimed that {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} is not positive semi-definite at root of unity, based on confusing Q_q^bar (coefficient conjugation) with Q_q^dagger (Fock space adjoint). This was mathematically false. See child node 1.4.3 for the detailed correction.\n\n(C4) FULL N=2 SUSY FOR ADMISSIBLE j: For j \u003c (r-2)/2, the root-of-unity q-BLM model is a well-defined N=2 SUSY quantum mechanics with: H_q = {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} \u003e= 0 as the Hamiltonian, ker(H_q) = ker(Q_q) intersect ker(Q_q^dagger) as genuine BPS ground states, and a well-defined Witten index with its standard SUSY interpretation.\n\n(C5) BOUNDARY BEHAVIOR: At the boundary j = (r-2)/2, the quantum dimension [2j+2]_q = [r]_q = 0 while [2j+1]_q remains nonzero for admissible j. The bubble identity normalization factor 1/[2j+1]_q (used in BLM Feynman diagram evaluation) is well-defined for j \u003c (r-2)/2 but singular effects may appear at the boundary depending on the parity of r and the specific diagrams evaluated.\n\n(C6) FINITE TRUNCATION: Unlike the q \u003e 0 real case where j can be any positive half-integer, the root-of-unity model exists only for finitely many values j satisfying the admissibility bound. This parallels the truncation in the Turaev-Viro state sum.\n\nLIMIT r -\u003e infinity: As r -\u003e infinity, q = exp(2*pi*i/r) -\u003e 1, and: (i) the admissibility bound (r-2)/2 -\u003e infinity becomes vacuous, recovering the unrestricted representation theory at q=1; (ii) the TV state sum formally approaches the Ponzano-Regge sum (though PR is divergent and requires regularization -- TV IS the regularization); (iii) for the BLM model at fixed j, the root-of-unity model smoothly recovers the q=1 model of Part I as r -\u003e infinity, since all representation-theoretic constraints become vacuous and the q-3j symbols continuously approach their q=1 values.","owner":"prover-14"}
