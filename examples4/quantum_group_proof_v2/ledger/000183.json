This is provably false. For j=1 and N=3, there are exactly 3 fermion modes (m = -1, 0, 1). The supercharge Q_q involves totally antisymmetric cubic terms in annihilation operators. Since there is only ONE totally antisymmetric combination of 3 indices chosen from {-1, 0, 1}, the supercharge is Q_q = c * psi_{-1} psi_0 psi_1 for some (possibly complex) coefficient c. Then Q_q^dagger = c* * psi_1^dagger psi_0^dagger psi_{-1}^dagger. The anticommutator {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} = |c|^2 * {psi_{-1} psi_0 psi_1, psi_1^dagger psi_0^dagger psi_{-1}^dagger}. Since |c|^2 \u003e= 0 and the fermion bilinear is a projector (hence PSD), the full operator is manifestly non-negative. The claim of negative eigenvalues for this case is false regardless of the value of q. The operator {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} acts on the 2^3=8 dimensional Fock space and has eigenvalues 0 (with multiplicity 6) and |c|^2 (with multiplicity 2).","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
