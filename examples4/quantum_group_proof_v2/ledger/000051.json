This is a strong claim based solely on comparing exponential growth rates. However:\n\n(1) PREFACTORS: Even when two quantities have different exponential rates, their ratio at any finite j depends on the prefactors. If the prefactor of the non-melonic diagram is exp(-c * j^2) for some c \u003e 0, it could suppress the exponential growth for physically relevant values of j. Saddle-point calculations often produce such non-trivial prefactors (e.g., the Ponzano-Regge formula has 1/j^{3/2} as prefactor). No analysis of q-deformed prefactors is provided.\n\n(2) COMBINATORIAL MULTIPLICITY: The number of melonic diagrams at a given loop order grows faster than non-melonic ones (this is the standard tensor/SYK large-N mechanism). Even if individual non-melonic diagrams grow faster, the total contribution of all melonic diagrams could still dominate due to their greater number. This combinatorial argument — the core mechanism of melonic dominance — is not addressed.\n\n(3) SIGN CANCELLATIONS: Non-melonic diagrams may involve oscillatory signs (as seen in the classical Ponzano-Regge cosine). For q-deformed 6j symbols, the asymptotics may involve oscillatory factors exp(i * j * phase) whose contributions cancel when summed over spins. The node considers only |{6j}_q| but the actual diagram contributions involve the signed/complex values.\n\n(4) THE q=1 CASE ITSELF ILLUSTRATES THE PROBLEM: At q=1, the individual tetrahedron diagram is NOT exponentially suppressed (it grows as sqrt(j)), and yet melonic dominance holds because of the specific polynomial ratio. The mechanism of melonic dominance at q=1 is NOT 'the non-melonic contribution is small', but rather 'it grows more slowly than the melonic contribution by a POLYNOMIAL factor'. The extrapolation to exponential growth rates is a qualitative leap that requires separate justification.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
