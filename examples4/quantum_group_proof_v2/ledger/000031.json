The hyperbolic case (q real positive) is discussed in Section 9 but the results are STATED WITHOUT PROOF. Therefore citing Taylor-Woodward as establishing |{6j}_q| ~ exp(j * Vol_hyp(q)) for real q is misleading - it is an unproven conjecture in that paper.\n\n(2) COSTANTINO (Geom Topol 2007, math/0611399): Works at q = e^{pi*sqrt(-1)/r}, a ROOT OF UNITY, with spins and r growing together proportionally. Not fixed real q.\n\n(3) BELLETTI-YANG (J Topology 2025, 2308.13864): Works under Turaev-Viro admissibility conditions, meaning q = e^{2*pi*i/r} ROOT OF UNITY with spins bounded by (r-2)/2. Asymptotic limit is r -\u003e infinity with spins proportional to r. NOT fixed real q.\n\nALL THREE references work in root-of-unity regimes. For fixed real q \u003e 0 with spins -\u003e infinity, the asymptotics are an open question. The node conflates two qualitatively different mathematical regimes.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
