The quantum 6j symbol {j j j; j j j}_q has exponential large-j asymptotics governed by the volume of the associated hyperbolic tetrahedron: |{6j}_q| ~ exp(j * Vol_hyp(q)) (Taylor-Woodward 2005, Costantino 2007, Belletti-Yang 2025). Non-melonic diagrams grow exponentially rather than being polynomially suppressed. The large-j dynamics is governed by hyperbolic 3D geometry, connecting to the Volume Conjecture (Kashaev 1997, Murakami-Murakami 2001). The model may admit a new solvable limit controlled by the dominant hyperbolic saddle.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"78d1749591db4ad613f98c8f2cd4c0e42d03162a74ca7532db06f63042c48d10","created":"2026-02-11T18:44:08.625645207Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
