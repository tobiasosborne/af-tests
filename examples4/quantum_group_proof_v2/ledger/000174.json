The node states q = exp(2*pi*i/r) and [2l+1]_q = sin((2l+1)*pi/r)/sin(pi/r). The formula sin((2l+1)*pi/r)/sin(pi/r) is obtained from the quantum integer [n]_q = (q^{n/2} - q^{-n/2})/(q^{1/2} - q^{-1/2}) with q = exp(2*pi*i/r), or equivalently [n]_A = (A^n - A^{-n})/(A - A^{-1}) with A = q^{1/2} = exp(i*pi/r). However, the more common convention [n]_q = (q^n - q^{-n})/(q - q^{-1}) would give sin(2*pi*n/r)/sin(2*pi/r), which is DIFFERENT. The node should explicitly specify which quantum integer convention is in use (e.g., by stating A = q^{1/2} = exp(i*pi/r) is used in the quantum dimension formula).","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
