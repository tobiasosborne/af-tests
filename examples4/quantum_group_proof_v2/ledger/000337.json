The derivation (Delta(j,j,j) has [3j+1]! in denominator; [n]_q = 0 iff r|n; need r \u003e 3j+1) is sound. The examples (j=1-\u003er\u003e=5, j=3-\u003er\u003e=11, j=5-\u003er\u003e=17) are correct. The counterexample (j=3, r=9) is valid. I verified that no other factorial terms in the Racah formula impose a stricter bound: the summation terms involve arguments up to 3j, and the magnetic quantum number factorials involve arguments up to 2j, both subsumed by r \u003e= 3j+2.\n\n(2) ERRATUM: Accurately describes the original errors (false SUSY breaking premise, false 1/[2j+1]_q divergence claim, wrong admissibility bound) and their corrections. This is honest and well-structured.\n\n(3) OP1: Well-posed open problem. Three required steps (a)-(c) correctly identified. Honest acknowledgment that none have been carried out. The triangulation-independence obstacle (restricting to odd spins breaks completeness of representation sum) is a genuine and important observation.\n\n(4) OP2(b)-(d): Spectral gap, BPS degeneracy, and Feynman diagram convergence are genuinely open and correctly formulated questions. The Witten index claim in (c) is standard SUSY lore.\n\n(5) OP3 caveats (I) and (II): Correctly identify the two obstacles to the single-coloring interpretation (sum over diagram topologies vs triangulations; single-coloring sector is not triangulation-independent). Level truncation condition 3j \u003c= r-2 is correctly stated.\n\n(6) L1: Correctly describes q -\u003e 1 limit with classical q=1 values. No longer mentions 'generic q' (previous error corrected). Uses (r-2)/3 as the spin truncation bound. PASS.\n\n(7) L2: Correctly describes TV as regularization of PR (not convergence). Includes (-1)^{2l}(2l+1) edge factor. Cosmological constant formula Lambda = 4*pi^2/(r-2)^2 with k = r-2 is correctly identified with standard TV conventions.\n\n(8) L3: Correctly states SUSY is present at ALL q and does not need recovery. Fixed j does not scale with r. Recovery is of algebraic simplifications of q=1 case only.\n\n(9) CONSISTENCY: Admissibility bound r \u003e= 3j+2 is consistent with parent 1.4 (C1) and sibling 1.4.3 (iii-a). Examples match across all three nodes.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
