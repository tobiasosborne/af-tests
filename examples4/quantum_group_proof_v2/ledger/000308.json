As r -\u003e infinity, q = exp(2*pi*i/r) -\u003e 1, so what is recovered is the classical representation theory of su(2) at q=1, NOT 'generic q' representation theory. The phrase 'generic q' in quantum group theory means q is not a root of unity and q \\!= 0,1, where the representation theory differs from the q=1 case (quantum dimensions [2l+1]_q differ from classical 2l+1). This was previously raised as challenge ch-d2f9555a67a356c4 and marked resolved, but the fix was not applied. L3 correctly states 'what is recovered in the q -\u003e 1 limit is the specific algebraic simplifications of the q=1 case,' contradicting L1's claim about 'generic q.' The child 1.4.4.1 has the corrected L1 wording.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
