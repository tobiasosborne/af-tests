By restricting to the figure-eight knot, the node obscures the generality of the VC while simultaneously claiming a general connection. More importantly, the VC as stated by Murakami-Murakami uses the SIMPLICIAL VOLUME (which equals the hyperbolic volume for hyperbolic knots), not \"Vol(S^3 \\ K)\" which could be ambiguous. For non-hyperbolic knots, the simplicial volume is zero, and the conjecture states that the limit is zero — there is no \"exponential growth\" for non-hyperbolic knots.\n\nAdditionally, the node uses \"J_n(q)\" as if J_n is a function of an independent variable q, when in the VC the evaluation point q = e^{2pi i/n} is DETERMINED by n. Writing \"J_n(q)\" suggests q is a free parameter, which reinforces the erroneous impression that one can take q to be a fixed real positive number (the BLM regime) and still have the VC apply.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
