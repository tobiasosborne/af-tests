The three required steps (a)-(c) are correctly identified, and the honest acknowledgment 'None of these steps has been carried out' is appropriate.\n\nHowever, OP1 omits a significant conceptual obstacle: the Boulatov GFT has a BOSONIC field phi on SU(2)^3, while the BLM model uses FERMIONS. A multi-spin BLM generalization with 'fermion species for each admissible l' would be a fermionic GFT, which differs fundamentally from the bosonic Boulatov model. The GFT literature does include fermionic extensions (e.g., Geloun-Bonzom), but the node does not acknowledge this distinction or cite the relevant literature.\n\nAdditionally, step (a) says 'possibly restricted to odd integers' for the admissible spins. The reason for this restriction (BLM uses odd j) is clear, but a TV state sum restricted to odd integer colorings is NOT a standard TV invariant and would NOT be triangulation-independent in general. The node should note that such a restriction would likely break topological invariance.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
