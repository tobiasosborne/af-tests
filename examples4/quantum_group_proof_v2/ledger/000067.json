The Volume Conjecture (Kashaev 1997, Murakami-Murakami 2001) concerns the COLORED JONES POLYNOMIAL J_N(K; q), which is a knot invariant. The precise statement is:\n\n  lim_{N -\u003e inf} (2pi/N) log |J_N(K; e^{2pi i/N})| = Vol(S^3 \\ K)\n\nwhere J_N is the N-colored Jones polynomial evaluated at q = e^{2pi i/N}. The central object is J_N, NOT the quantum 6j symbol.\n\nThe connection between the colored Jones polynomial and quantum 6j symbols is INDIRECT: J_N can be expressed via state sums that involve quantum 6j symbols (when using a triangulation of the knot complement), but this requires: (a) Choosing a specific triangulation of S^3 \\ K, (b) Summing over spin labelings of edges, with weights involving products of quantum 6j symbols, (c) The asymptotics of the full state sum (involving combinatorial sums of products of many 6j symbols) is far more subtle than the asymptotics of any individual 6j symbol.\n\nThe exponential growth rate of an individual quantum 6j symbol is related to the volume of an individual TETRAHEDRON in a triangulation, not to the volume of the knot complement. The Volume Conjecture concerns the volume of the ENTIRE knot complement, which emerges from the COLLECTIVE behavior of all 6j symbols in the state sum.\n\nSaying \"Vol_hyp(q) of the quantum 6j symbol is the central object of the Volume Conjecture\" conflates a single building block with the full invariant.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
