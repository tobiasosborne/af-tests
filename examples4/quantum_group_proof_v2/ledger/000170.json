However, the node makes claims about the BLM model's Feynman diagrams (tetrahedron = 6j, cube = 12j, fixed j odd integer, 0+1d QM) that logically depend on the content established in nodes under 1.1 and 1.2 (the q=1 and general q\u003e0 parts of the proof tree). A dependency on node 1.2 (or whichever node establishes the BLM Feynman diagram structure) would make the logical flow more explicit. This is not blocking since the BLM facts are also directly verifiable from the paper.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
