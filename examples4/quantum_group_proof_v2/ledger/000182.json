As demonstrated by challenge ch-4dfe459e979 on node 1.4, the claimed SUSY obstruction is mathematically wrong: {Q, Q^dagger} \u003e= 0 holds for ALL q, including roots of unity.\n\nSince the 'obstruction' does not exist, the claim that it 'disappears' as q -\u003e 1 is vacuously true but misleadingly framed. The correct statement is simpler: as r -\u003e infinity, q -\u003e 1, and the root-of-unity algebraic complications (finite truncation of representations, potential singularities of q-3j symbols at boundary of admissible range) disappear, recovering the q=1 model. The SUSY structure H \u003e= 0 is present at ALL q and does not need to be 'recovered'.\n\nThe sentence should be corrected to remove the false reference to a SUSY obstruction, or at minimum should acknowledge that H = {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} \u003e= 0 holds at root of unity and that the actual complications are of a different nature (representation truncation, admissibility constraints, potential divergences).","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
