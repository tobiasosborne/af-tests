The correct formula is TV_r(M) = D_r^{-2|V|} * sum_{colorings} prod_{edges} [2f(e)+1]_q * prod_{tetra} {6j}_q, where |V| is the number of vertices of the triangulation T. The exponent is -2|V|, not simply -2. See Turaev-Viro (1992) Topology 31, eq. (1.1). The node's D_r^{-2} is wrong by a factor of D_r^{2-2|V|} which varies with the triangulation (though the full invariant is of course triangulation-independent).","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
