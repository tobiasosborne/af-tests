With Sigma_q = JN/[N]_q, the SD equations DO still close (the self-energy is still proportional to delta_{m,m'} and hence the SD equations have the same form as SYK), but with an effective coupling J_eff = JN/[N]_q that depends on j and q. This J_eff approaches J as q-\u003e1. The equations 'close' in the sense that the melonic SD equations take the same functional form (Sigma = J_eff * G^2 * G_b for N=2 SUSY SYK), just with a modified coupling. This should be stated explicitly because 'breaks N-independence' might be misread as 'SD equations do not close', which would be wrong. The key distinction between (a) and (b) is not whether the SD equations close (they do in both cases), but whether the effective coupling is q-dependent.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
