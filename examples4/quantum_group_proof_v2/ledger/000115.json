This conjecture is motivated by proven root-of-unity results but is NOT itself established. The analysis below is organized into: (A) the proven mathematical foundation, (B) the conjectural extension to fixed real q, (C) conditional consequences for the q-BLM model, and (D) the Volume Conjecture analogy.\n\n(A) PROVEN FOUNDATION (root-of-unity regime). For q = exp(2*pi*i/r) with r a positive odd integer and spins scaling proportionally with r under Turaev-Viro admissibility, the quantum 6j symbol has exponential asymptotics governed by hyperbolic tetrahedron volumes: lim_{r -\u003e inf, r odd} (2*pi/r) * ln|{6j}_{q=exp(2*pi*i/r)}| = Vol(Delta_hyp), where the volume can be positive, negative, or zero depending on the specific geometric configuration (Belletti-Yang, J Topology 2025; extending Costantino, Geom Topol 2007). Taylor-Woodward (Selecta Math 2005) prove the spherical case and state the hyperbolic case without proof. These results concern a DIFFERENT regime from fixed real q: here q is complex on the unit circle and both q and spins scale together (child 1.3.1(A),(D)).\n\n(B) CONJECTURAL EXTENSION TO FIXED REAL q \u003e 0. For fixed real q \u003e 0, q != 1, with spins j -\u003e infinity, the analogous exponential asymptotics remain an OPEN CONJECTURE (Taylor-Woodward 2005, Section 9, stated without proof). Key constraints on any such formula:\n  (i) q \u003c-\u003e q^{-1} SYMMETRY: Since [n]_q = [n]_{q^{-1}}, the quantum 6j symbol satisfies {6j}_q = {6j}_{q^{-1}}. Any exponential growth rate V(q) must satisfy V(q) = V(q^{-1}). In particular, it is IMPOSSIBLE for V(q) \u003e 0 when q \u003e 1 and V(q) \u003c 0 when 0 \u003c q \u003c 1 (child 1.3.1(C)).\n  (ii) UNDEFINED GEOMETRY: The Gram matrix construction that defines the hyperbolic tetrahedron in the root-of-unity case (dihedral angles from spin/r ratios) has no established analogue for fixed real q. The geometric object Vol_hyp(Delta(q, j_i)) requires definition in this regime.\n\n(C) CONDITIONAL CONSEQUENCES FOR q-BLM (assuming conjectural asymptotics from (B)).\n  (C1) Non-melonic scaling: At q=1 (established), the first non-melonic diagram is the 12j cube (8-vertex diagram, Draft.tex lines 612-622), suppressed by (log j)/j relative to the melonic vacuum. The tetrahedron diagram does not appear in the oriented BLM model (Draft.tex line 556). IF quantum recoupling symbols grow exponentially for fixed real q != 1, the polynomial suppression mechanism fails. However, this conclusion carries significant caveats: (i) 12j asymptotics for q != 1 are unknown and may differ from 6j behavior, (ii) the vertex normalization choice (classical vs q-adapted, per node 1.1.2) critically affects the scaling analysis, (iii) sub-exponential prefactors, oscillatory phases, sign cancellations, and combinatorial multiplicity of melonic diagrams could restore effective suppression (child 1.3.2).\n  (C2) Phase structure: IF melonic dominance breaks down, the Schwinger-Dyson equations of the q=1 theory no longer close, and the SYK-type solvability mechanism is lost. The resulting large-j physics would require fundamentally new techniques beyond the melonic SD equations. Whether a well-defined large-j limit exists for q != 1 (and whether it exhibits any non-analyticity at q=1) are OPEN QUESTIONS. No free energy has been defined, and no proof of non-analyticity has been given (child 1.3.3, open).\n  (C3) BPS sector: The SUSY algebra Q_q^2 = 0, H_q = {Q_q, Q_q-dagger} \u003e= 0 is preserved for all q \u003e 0, but whether the BPS degeneracy D^BPS_q equals D^BPS_{q=1} = 2 * 3^j for all q \u003e 0 is an OPEN QUESTION. The Q_q-dagger annihilation condition involves q-dependent cancellations that are unproven for q != 1 (child 1.3.5, validated).\n\n(D) VOLUME CONJECTURE ANALOGY (motivating, not mathematical equivalence). The Volume Conjecture (Kashaev 1997, Murakami-Murakami 2001) states lim_{N -\u003e inf} (2*pi/N) * log|J_N(K; e^{2*pi*i/N})| = Vol(S^3 \\ K) for hyperbolic knots, where J_N is the colored Jones polynomial. This concerns q = e^{2*pi*i/N} varying with N along roots of unity (a semiclassical limit), which is a DIFFERENT mathematical regime from the q-BLM model (fixed real q, spins -\u003e infinity). The connection is an ANALOGY: both settings involve quantum 6j symbols as building blocks and both feature hyperbolic volumes in asymptotic formulas. However, the colored Jones polynomial (a knot invariant built from state sums over many 6j symbols) is not the same as an individual 6j symbol, and the BLM partition function is not known to compute any knot invariant (child 1.3.4, open).\n\nSTATUS: The core claim of this section — that melonic dominance breaks down for fixed real q != 1 — is a CONJECTURE, not a theorem. It is motivated by proven root-of-unity results but depends on unestablished exponential asymptotics for fixed real q. Even conditionally, the conclusion requires assumptions about 12j symbols, vertex normalizations, and the absence of compensating cancellations. The Volume Conjecture provides motivating analogy but not mathematical equivalence. Whether the q-BLM model admits any tractable large-j limit for q != 1 is an open question.","owner":"prover-1.3"}
