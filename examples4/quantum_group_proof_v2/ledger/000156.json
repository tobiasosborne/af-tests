Kashaev (1997) indeed originally stated it for hyperbolic knots, but the Murakami-Murakami generalization — which is the standard modern formulation — applies to all knots. The node's parenthetical clarification about simplicial volume partially addresses this, but the lead sentence restricts to hyperbolic knots, which is narrower than the standard formulation. Since the node explicitly cites \"Murakami-Murakami 2001\" as its reference, it should state the conjecture at full generality: \"For any knot K in S^3, the conjecture states... where Vol denotes the simplicial volume.\" The restriction to hyperbolic knots would then be a special case where the simplicial volume equals the hyperbolic volume and may be nonzero.\n\n(2) MICROSCOPIC MECHANISM CLAIM: In section (C)(i), the node states that exponential 6j growth \"is the microscopic mechanism underlying the VC.\" This is a standard heuristic in the quantum gravity community, but it is more nuanced than stated. The VC concerns the collective behavior of the full state sum, as the node itself correctly emphasizes in section (A). The individual 6j asymptotics provide the individual tetrahedron contributions, but the VC emergence requires that the saddle-point analysis of the sum over all spin labelings localizes correctly onto a geometric triangulation — a nontrivial step that has been verified only for specific knots (e.g., the figure-eight knot via ideal triangulations). Calling individual 6j asymptotics \"the microscopic mechanism underlying the VC\" slightly overstates the proven status, since the full conjecture remains open and the localization step is not established in general. A more precise phrasing would be: \"is the conjectured microscopic mechanism underlying the VC\" or \"is the microscopic mechanism underlying state-sum approaches to the VC.\"\n\nNeither issue is blocking; both are requests for precision.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
