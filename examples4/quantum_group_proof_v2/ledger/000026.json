The first non-melonic diagram that actually appears is the cube/12j with (log j)/j suppression. (2) The prefactor uses j^{3/2} where the exact Ponzano-Regge formula has (j+1/2)^{3/2}; correct only to leading asymptotic order. Neither issue affects mathematical validity.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
