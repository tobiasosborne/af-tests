This is stricter than the BLM admissibility bound j \u003c= (r-2)/2 (using the WRONG bound from this node) or j \u003c= (r-2)/3 (using the CORRECT Racah bound from 1.4.3, where the two coincide). For the wrong bound r \u003e= 2j+3, there is a gap: (r-2)/3 \u003c j \u003c= (r-2)/2 where BLM is admissible but (j,j,j) is NOT TV-admissible. Example: r=9, j=3 satisfies j \u003c= 3.5 = (r-2)/2, but 3j=9 \u003e 7=r-2 so (3,3,3) fails TV admissibility. The child 1.4.4.1 has the corrected two-regime analysis. The OP3 caveats (I) and (II) are well-stated but the admissibility discussion is incomplete without the level truncation condition.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
