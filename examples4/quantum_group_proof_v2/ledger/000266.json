For integer j, the inequality j \u003c= (r-2)/2 is equivalent to 2j \u003c= r-2, i.e., r \u003e= 2j+2.\n\nThe claimed equivalence r \u003e= 2j+3 is strictly stronger (one unit too restrictive). Specifically:\n\n(1) When r is EVEN: (r-2)/2 is an integer. j \u003c= (r-2)/2 iff r \u003e= 2j+2. For example, j=1 and r=4: (r-2)/2 = 1 \u003e= j=1, so j is admissible. But 2j+3 = 5 \u003e 4 = r, so the claimed equivalence excludes this valid case.\n\n(2) When r is ODD: (r-2)/2 is a half-integer. The largest integer j satisfying j \u003c= (r-2)/2 is j = (r-3)/2, giving r \u003e= 2j+3. So r \u003e= 2j+3 is correct ONLY for odd r.\n\nVerification that r = 2j+2 is genuinely admissible: At r = 2j+2, j = (r-2)/2 exactly. The quantum dimension [2j+1]_q = [r-1]_q = sin((r-1)*pi/r)/sin(pi/r) \u003e 0. The Racah formula for the 3j symbols with all spins j involves quantum factorials [n]_q! for n \u003c= 2j = r-2 \u003c r, so no zero denominators appear. The q-3j symbols ARE well-defined at r = 2j+2.\n\nConsequently, the concrete examples in (C1) are also wrong:\n- j=1: correct minimal r is 4 (not 5)\n- j=3: correct minimal r is 8 (not 9)\n- j=5: correct minimal r is 12 (not 13)\n\nNOTE: This is classified as minor because the MATHEMATICAL CONTENT of (C1) is correct (the q-3j symbols require j \u003c= (r-2)/2), and the error is only in the stated \"equivalence\" being one unit too restrictive. The actual bound j \u003c= (r-2)/2 is correct throughout the node; only the parenthetical \"(equivalently r \u003e= 2j+3 for the integer case)\" and the concrete examples use the incorrect stronger bound.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
