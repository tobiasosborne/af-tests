For the q-deformed model, the bubble gives 1/[2j+1]_q instead of 1/(2j+1). The self-energy depends on the vertex normalization of Q_q: (a) classical normalization sqrt(2JN) gives Sigma_q = JN/[N]_q (q-dependent, breaks N-independence); (b) q-adapted normalization sqrt(2J[N]_q) gives Sigma_q = J (q-independent, SD equations close identically to SYK). The choice of normalization is part of the model definition and determines whether the melonic sector is q-deformed or not. The v1 formula Sigma = J/[N]_q is wrong in both cases.
