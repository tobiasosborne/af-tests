Its key property: each Feynman diagram Gamma of the Boulatov model is dual to a triangulation T_Gamma of a 3-dimensional simplicial complex, and the Feynman amplitude A(Gamma) equals the Ponzano-Regge amplitude of T_Gamma. When SU(2) is replaced by the quantum group U_q(su(2)) at q = exp(2*pi*i/r), the Feynman amplitudes become exactly the Turaev-Viro amplitudes of the dual triangulations. The BLM model shares the algebraic building blocks (quantum 3j symbols at the vertex, quantum 6j symbols in non-melonic diagrams) but differs structurally from the Boulatov model in three ways: (1) BLM uses a SINGLE fixed spin j (odd integer), while Boulatov/TV sums over ALL admissible spins; (2) BLM is a 0+1 dimensional quantum mechanics with a fixed finite number N = 2j+1 of fermionic modes, while Boulatov is a field theory on a group manifold generating arbitrary triangulations; (3) BLM diagrams arise from a specific Hamiltonian H_q = {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} on a Fock space, while Boulatov diagrams arise from a partition function integral. Consequence: individual BLM non-melonic Feynman diagrams (tetrahedron involving {6j}_q, cube involving {12j}_q, etc.) evaluate to the SAME quantum recoupling symbols that appear as TV weights, but the BLM Feynman expansion does NOT produce a sum over triangulations of 3-manifolds. The map from the full BLM diagram expansion to TV-type topological invariants remains an open problem.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"fd0e0b775aadf717d6dc05940d334622d6a51e6fc4bdefe5b0fba7519f5808f2","created":"2026-02-11T20:04:40.463323729Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
