This is the REPRESENTATION boundary, not the Racah boundary. Under the operative Racah bound r \u003e= 3j+2, the BLM model only admits j \u003c= (r-2)/3. The representation boundary j = (r-2)/2 lies OUTSIDE the Racah admissibility region for all j \u003e= 1 (since (r-2)/2 \u003e (r-2)/3 for r \u003e 2). The parent node 1.4 section (C5) explicitly states: 'The genuine boundary singularity [2j+2]_q = [r]_q = 0 occurs at the weaker representation-admissibility boundary j = (r-2)/2, which lies OUTSIDE the Racah admissibility region r \u003e= 3j+2 for j \u003e= 1.' OP2(a) discusses complications at a boundary that the BLM model can never reach. While the discussion is mathematically correct as a statement about U_q(su(2)) representation theory, it should explicitly note that j = (r-2)/2 is not BLM-admissible. The question 'What is the behavior of the BLM spectrum near this boundary?' should clarify that 'near' means j approaching (r-2)/3, not (r-2)/2. The complications from [r]_q = 0 affecting recoupling identities are real but arise in the broader quantum group theory, not directly in the BLM model at admissible j.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
