Section (C1) correctly notes in caveat (i) that '12j asymptotics for q != 1 are unknown and may differ from 6j behavior.' However, the SUMMARY uses the phrase 'quantum recoupling symbols' (plural, generic) which encompasses 6j, 9j, 12j, and higher symbols, when the conjectural exponential asymptotics (node 1.3.1 part B) are stated only for 6j symbols. Since the ACTUAL first non-melonic diagram involves a 12j symbol (not a 6j symbol), the conditional chain has an implicit additional assumption: that the conjectured exponential growth of 6j symbols extends to 12j symbols. This is plausible but not automatic -- higher recoupling symbols involve sums of products of 6j symbols with potentially complex phase structure and sign cancellations that could modify the exponential rate. The SUMMARY would be more precise with: 'due to (conjectured) exponential growth of quantum 6j symbols and (further conjectured) similar behavior of higher recoupling symbols.' The caveats in (C1) do address this, so this is a clarity issue, not a mathematical error.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
