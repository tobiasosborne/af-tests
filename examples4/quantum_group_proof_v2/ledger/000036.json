This analysis is not provided in node 1.3 or its children.\n\n(2) 'The model may admit a new solvable limit controlled by the dominant hyperbolic saddle.' - Appropriately hedged with 'may', but the mechanism for solvability is unexplained. In the SYK/melonic limit, solvability comes from Schwinger-Dyson equations closing in the large-N limit. If melonic dominance breaks down, the standard mechanism for solvability is lost. What replaces it? The claim of a 'hyperbolic saddle' providing solvability needs at least a sketch of the mechanism.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
