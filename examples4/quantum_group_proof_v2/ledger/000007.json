The quantum 6j symbols become building blocks of the Turaev-Viro state sum TV_r(M) = D^{-2v} sum prod [2j_e+1]_q prod |{6j}_q|^2, a topological invariant satisfying TV_r = |tau_r|^2 (Turaev-Walker). The non-melonic corrections in this regime are controlled by topological 3D gravity (Euclidean 3D gravity with Lambda ~ 1/k^2). The limit r -\u003e infinity recovers regime I. NOTE: This regime requires q complex (|q|=1), a qualitative change from q \u003e 0 real in Parts 0-II, requiring analytic continuation.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"0b88b77c800efd395c162aec9e14fee8d09f1960e98ceb07cf0932a93dc06953","created":"2026-02-11T18:44:08.625649653Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
