However, it does not state the NECESSARY CONDITION for the BLM model to be well-defined at root of unity: the BLM spin parameter j (fixed odd integer) must satisfy j \u003c= (r-2)/2, equivalently r \u003e= 2j+3. Without this constraint, the quantum dimension [2j+1]_q = sin((2j+1)*pi/r)/sin(pi/r) can vanish (when 2j+1 = r), the q-3j symbols can have poles, and the supercharge Q_q becomes ill-defined. This is also raised as challenge ch-4246ac870af on node 1.4 and ch-acbdd5a5b3a on node 1.4.4. The root node's statement reads as if 'spin truncation j \u003c= (r-2)/2' is a FEATURE of regime (III) (analogous to how TV uses spins up to (r-2)/2), rather than a CONSTRAINT on when the BLM model itself makes sense. The distinction matters: the TV state sum is well-defined for all r \u003e= 3, but the q-BLM model at root of unity q = exp(2*pi*i/r) is only well-defined when the chosen j satisfies the admissibility bound. For j=1 one needs r \u003e= 5; for j=3 one needs r \u003e= 9; etc.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
