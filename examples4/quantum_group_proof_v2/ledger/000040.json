However, the BLM paper (Draft.tex line 258) defines Q = (1/3\\!)sqrt(2JN) sum C psi psi psi, so the raw coupling prefactor contains sqrt(2JN), not sqrt(NJ). The Lagrangian vertex factor (line 283) is sqrt(JN/2). The paper reconciles this on line 526 by saying 'each vertex has a factor of sqrt(N)*sqrt(J) = sqrt(NJ)', which implicitly absorbs a factor of sqrt(2) from Wick contraction combinatorics (there are 2 ways to pair the two internal lines). The node's classical section uses the effective vertex sqrt(NJ) (paper convention), but the q-deformed cases reference 'classical normalization sqrt(2JN)' and 'q-adapted normalization sqrt(2J[N]_q)' (raw coupling convention). This mixes two conventions within a single node. The final numerical results are all correct because the factors of 2 cancel consistently, but the notation is not self-consistent. Suggest: either use sqrt(2JN) throughout (and note the factor-of-2 Wick combinatorics) or use sqrt(NJ) throughout (and note this is the effective vertex).","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
