This CONFIRMS and STRENGTHENS the parent node 1.3 challenge.\n\n(1) TAYLOR-WOODWARD (Selecta Math 2005, math/0305113): The main theorems (Sections 4-8) prove 6j asymptotics for q a PRIMITIVE ROOT OF UNITY (q = e^{2*pi*i/r}), relating to SPHERICAL tetrahedra. Section 9 discusses the hyperbolic case (q real positive) but STATES RESULTS WITHOUT PROOF. Multiple secondary sources confirm this.\n\n(2) COSTANTINO (Geom Topol 2007, math/0611399): Works at q = e^{pi*i/p}, a ROOT OF UNITY, with the asymptotic limit being p -\u003e infinity. The paper relates the growth rate to volumes of hyperbolic TRUNCATED tetrahedra. NOT fixed real q with spins -\u003e infinity.\n\n(3) BELLETTI-YANG (J Topology 2025, 2308.13864): Evaluates quantum 6j-symbols at q = e^{2*pi*i/r} with r an ODD POSITIVE INTEGER, under Turaev-Viro admissibility conditions. The main theorem proves: lim_{r -\u003e inf, r odd} (2*pi/r) * ln|{6j}_{q=exp(2*pi*i/r)}| = Vol_hyp. The limit is r -\u003e infinity (NOT n -\u003e infinity with fixed q), and the scaling is (2*pi/r), NOT (1/n).\n\nCONCLUSION: None of the three cited references proves the claimed result for fixed real q \u003e 0. The formula lim (1/n) log |{nj1,...,nj6}_q| = Vol_hyp for fixed real q \u003e 0 remains an UNPROVEN CONJECTURE presented as established fact.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
