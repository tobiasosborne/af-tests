This was mathematically false. The error arose from conflating Q_q^bar (defined by conjugating the q-3j coefficients while keeping the same fermion operator ordering) with Q_q^dagger (the Fock space adjoint). For the cubic supercharge, Q_q^dagger = -Q_q^bar (with the sign from reversing the order of three fermion creation/annihilation operators). Therefore {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} = -{Q_q, Q_q^bar}. The original argument then incorrectly suggested that since Q_q^bar is not the Fock adjoint, the anticommutator {Q_q, Q_q^bar} could have positive eigenvalues making -{Q_q, Q_q^bar} negative. In fact, {Q_q, Q_q^bar} must have all eigenvalues \u003c= 0, precisely because -{Q_q, Q_q^bar} = {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} \u003e= 0 by the tautological norm argument. The claimed j=1, q=exp(2*pi*i/5) counterexample was also incorrect: for N=3 (three fermion modes), Q_q is proportional to a single cubic monomial psi_{-1} psi_0 psi_1, so {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} = |c|^2 * {A, A^dagger} \u003e= 0 trivially.\n\n(iii) GENUINE REPRESENTATION-THEORETIC CONSTRAINTS: At q = exp(2*pi*i/r), the representation theory of U_q(su(2)) truncates to finitely many admissible irreducible representations with spin labels l = 0, 1/2, 1, ..., (r-2)/2. This imposes three constraints on the BLM model:\n\n(iii-a) ADMISSIBILITY BOUND: The BLM model parameter j must satisfy 2j+1 \u003c= r-1, i.e., j \u003c= (r-2)/2. For j exceeding this bound, the quantum 3j symbols C^j_q(m1,m2,m3) involve quantum factorials [n]_q! with n \u003e= r, and since [r]_q = 0 when q = exp(2*pi*i/r), these factorials vanish, causing the 3j symbols to be ill-defined (division by zero in the Racah formula).\n\n(iii-b) BOUNDARY SINGULARITY: At the boundary j = (r-2)/2, the quantum dimension [2j+1]_q = [r-1]_q approaches a limiting value, while [2j+2]_q = [r]_q = 0. This makes the bubble identity (used in the BLM Feynman diagram evaluation, cf. node 1.2) singular: the normalization factor 1/[2j+1]_q in the bubble requires [2j+1]_q != 0, which holds for j \u003c (r-2)/2 but may fail at the boundary depending on the parity of r.\n\n(iii-c) FINITE TRUNCATION: Unlike the q \u003e 0 real case where the BLM parameter j can be any positive half-integer, the root-of-unity model exists only for finitely many values j = 1, 3/2, 2, ..., (r-2)/2 (restricting to half-integers satisfying the admissibility bound with j \u003e= 1 for the BLM cubic interaction to be non-trivial). This finite truncation parallels the truncation in the Turaev-Viro state sum.\n\nCONCLUSION: The root-of-unity q-BLM model retains its full N=2 SUSY structure for admissible j \u003c (r-2)/2: the supercharge satisfies Q_q^2 = 0, the Hamiltonian H_q = {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} \u003e= 0, BPS states (ker H_q) are genuine ground states, and the Witten index retains its standard SUSY interpretation. The genuine mathematical issues at root of unity are representation-theoretic -- truncation of admissible spins, potential boundary singularities, and the constraint to finitely many models -- rather than a failure of the SUSY structure itself. The combinatorial Feynman diagram expansion and its connection to quantum recoupling symbols (nodes 1.4.1, 1.4.2) also survive intact for admissible j.","new_statement":"Step 1.4.3 (Root-of-unity regime: SUSY preserved, representation-theoretic constraints): At q = exp(2*pi*i/r) with r \u003e= 3 an integer, the q-deformed BLM model retains its N=2 SUSY structure but faces genuine representation-theoretic constraints on admissibility. We establish three facts, assuming the BLM model parameter j is an ODD INTEGER j \u003e= 1 (following the BLM paper Definition 1).

This was mathematically false. The error arose from conflating Q_q^bar (defined by conjugating the q-3j coefficients while keeping the same fermion operator ordering) with Q_q^dagger (the Fock space adjoint). For the cubic supercharge, Q_q^dagger = -Q_q^bar (with the sign from reversing the order of three fermion creation/annihilation operators, giving (-1)^{3(3-1)/2} = (-1)^3 = -1). Therefore {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} = -{Q_q, Q_q^bar}. The original argument then incorrectly suggested that since Q_q^bar is not the Fock adjoint, the anticommutator {Q_q, Q_q^bar} could have positive eigenvalues making -{Q_q, Q_q^bar} negative.

This imposes constraints on the BLM model, which we analyze by separating two distinct conditions:\n\nCONDITION A (REPRESENTATION ADMISSIBILITY): For the spin-j representation of U_q(su(2)) to exist, we need the quantum dimension [2j+1]_q to be well-defined and nonzero, which requires 2j+1 \u003c r (since [r]_q = 0). For integer j this gives r \u003e= 2j+2. This is the condition for the spin-j Hilbert space to be well-defined.\n\nCONDITION B (RACAH FORMULA WELL-DEFINEDNESS FOR (j,j,j)): The BLM supercharge Q_q uses the quantum 3j symbol (j,j,j; m1,m2,m3) with all three spins equal to j. The Racah formula for this 3j symbol involves the triangle coefficient Delta(j,j,j), whose denominator contains [j+j+j+1]! = [3j+1]!. This factorial equals the product [1]_q [2]_q ... [3j+1]_q. For this to be well-defined (no zero factors), we need [n]_q != 0 for all n = 1, ..., 3j+1, which requires r \u003e 3j+1, i.e., r \u003e= 3j+2. Equivalently, j \u003c= (r-2)/3. This is the same as the TURAEV-VIRO ADMISSIBILITY CONDITION for the triple (j,j,j): the level truncation a+b+c \u003c= r-2 applied to (j,j,j) gives 3j \u003c= r-2, i.e., r \u003e= 3j+2.\n\nWHICH BOUND APPLIES: For the BLM model, Condition B (r \u003e= 3j+2) is STRICTER than Condition A (r \u003e= 2j+2) for all j \u003e= 1. Since the BLM supercharge requires the (j,j,j) 3j symbol, Condition B is the operative constraint. Concretely for odd integer j: j=1 requires r \u003e= 5; j=3 requires r \u003e= 11; j=5 requires r \u003e= 17.\n\nNOTE ON PARENT NODE INCONSISTENCY: The parent node 1.4 states the admissibility bound as r \u003e= 2j+3, with examples j=1 -\u003e r\u003e=5, j=3 -\u003e r\u003e=9, j=5 -\u003e r\u003e=13. The parent's bound r \u003e= 2j+3 is intermediate between Conditions A and B. The example j=1 -\u003e r\u003e=5 happens to agree with Condition B (3*1+2=5), but j=3 -\u003e r\u003e=9 disagrees with Condition B (3*3+2=11). We adopt the stricter Condition B here as the mathematically correct bound for the BLM (j,j,j) 3j symbols. The parent node should be updated to match.\n\nREMARK: It is possible that for specific values of (j,r) violating r \u003e= 3j+2 but satisfying r \u003e= 2j+2, cancellations in the Racah formula render the 3j symbol finite despite individual factorial factors being ill-defined. Such cancellations would need to be established on a case-by-case basis and do not affect the general admissibility criterion stated here.\n\n(iii-a) ADMISSIBILITY BOUND (corrected): The BLM model parameter j (odd integer \u003e= 1) must satisfy r \u003e= 3j+2 (equivalently j \u003c= (r-2)/3) for the quantum 3j symbols C^j_q(m1,m2,m3) appearing in the supercharge Q_q to be well-defined via the Racah formula. For j exceeding this bound, [3j+1]! in the Delta coefficient involves [kr]_q = 0 for some integer k, causing division by zero. The weaker condition r \u003e= 2j+2 suffices for the spin-j representation itself to be admissible but does NOT guarantee well-definedness of the (j,j,j) coupling.\n\n(iii-b) BOUNDARY BEHAVIOR (corrected): At the boundary j = (r-2)/3 (when this is an odd integer), we analyze the quantum dimensions:\n- [2j+1]_q = [2(r-2)/3 + 1]_q: For this boundary value, 2j+1 = (2r-1)/3, and [2j+1]_q = sin((2r-1)*pi/(3r))/sin(pi/r), which is generically nonzero.\n- More generally, for ANY admissible j satisfying r \u003e= 3j+2: [2j+1]_q = sin((2j+1)*pi/r)/sin(pi/r). Since 1 \u003c= 2j+1 \u003c= r-1 for r \u003e= 2j+2, and sin(n*pi/r) \u003e 0 for 0 \u003c n \u003c r, the quantum dimension [2j+1]_q is strictly positive for all admissible j. In particular, at j = (r-2)/2 (the representation-admissibility boundary, which is LESS strict than the Racah bound): [2j+1]_q = [r-1]_q = sin((r-1)*pi/r)/sin(pi/r) = sin(pi/r)/sin(pi/r) = 1 for ALL r \u003e= 3. There is NO parity dependence.\n- The bubble identity normalization factor 1/[2j+1]_q is therefore well-defined and nonsingular for all j satisfying the admissibility bound r \u003e= 3j+2. There is no boundary singularity in 1/[2j+1]_q.\n- The genuine boundary issue is that [2j+2]_q = [r]_q = 0 when 2j+2 = r (i.e., at the representation-admissibility boundary), which affects recoupling identities involving sums over intermediate spins up to j+1 (such as the Biedenharn-Elliott identity or orthogonality relations for 6j symbols). However, this boundary lies OUTSIDE the Racah admissibility region r \u003e= 3j+2 for j \u003e= 1.\n\n(iii-c) FINITE TRUNCATION (corrected): The root-of-unity BLM model exists only for the finitely many ODD INTEGERS j = 1, 3, 5, ..., j_max(r), where j_max(r) is the largest odd integer satisfying j \u003c= (r-2)/3. Concretely: for r=5, j_max=1 (only j=1); for r=11, j_max=3 (j=1,3); for r=17, j_max=5 (j=1,3,5); for r=20, j_max=5 (since 5 \u003c= 18/3=6 but 7 \u003e 6); for r=23, j_max=7 (j=1,3,5,7). This is a much sparser set than the TV coloring labels l = 0, 1/2, 1, ..., (r-2)/2 because: (a) j must be a positive ODD integer (BLM model specification), not an arbitrary half-integer; and (b) the Racah bound j \u003c= (r-2)/3 is stricter than the representation bound l \u003c= (r-2)/2.\n\nCONCLUSION: The root-of-unity q-BLM model retains its full N=2 SUSY structure for admissible odd integer j satisfying r \u003e= 3j+2: the supercharge satisfies Q_q^2 = 0, the Hamiltonian H_q = {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} \u003e= 0, BPS states (ker H_q) are genuine ground states, and the Witten index retains its standard SUSY interpretation. The genuine mathematical issues at root of unity are representation-theoretic -- the Racah formula admissibility bound limiting j to j \u003c= (r-2)/3, the constraint to finitely many odd-integer models, and the interplay between the Racah bound and the TV level truncation -- rather than a failure of the SUSY structure itself. The combinatorial Feynman diagram expansion and its connection to quantum recoupling symbols (nodes 1.4.1, 1.4.2) also survive intact for admissible j.","owner":"prover-143-v3"}
