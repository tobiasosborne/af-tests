This creates an inconsistency: the parameter domain is stated as q \u003e 0 real, but regime (III) has q = exp(2*pi*i/r) which is COMPLEX (|q| = 1, not real for r \u003e= 3). The root node does not explain how the model extends from the stated domain q \u003e 0 real to the complex unit circle. Nodes 1.1.1 (braided fermions) and 1.4.3 discuss this extension, but the root node's statement jumps between the real-q and root-of-unity regimes without acknowledging that they involve different domains of the parameter q and potentially different algebraic structures (finite-dimensional vs. truncated representations of U_q(su(2))).","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
