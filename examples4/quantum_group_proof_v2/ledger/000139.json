For the BLM model with fixed odd integer j at root of unity q = exp(2*pi*i/r), the parameter r must satisfy r \u003e= 2j+3 (equivalently j \u003c= (r-3)/2 for integer j, or more precisely j must be an admissible spin in the truncated representation theory, i.e., j \u003c= (r-2)/2).\n\nThis constraint is NEVER stated in node 1.4 or any of its children. Without it:\n- The q-3j symbols C^j_q(m1,m2,m3) may be undefined or infinite\n- The quantum dimension [2j+1]_q may vanish (making the bubble identity singular)\n- The supercharge Q_q is ill-defined\n\nFor example: j=1 requires r \u003e= 5; j=3 requires r \u003e= 9; j=5 requires r \u003e= 13.\n\nThis is a necessary condition for ALL statements in the node about the root-of-unity BLM model. The constraint should be stated explicitly in node 1.4's preamble and in child 1.4.1.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
