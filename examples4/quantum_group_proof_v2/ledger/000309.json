This is a model of honest error correction. (2) OP1: The BLM-to-TV open problem is well-posed. The identification of three required steps (a)-(c) is correct. The obstacle about triangulation independence breaking when restricting to odd-integer spins is a genuine and important observation. The fermionic GFT reference remains vague ('Geloun-Bonzom') but this was previously noted and is a minor bibliographic issue. (3) OP2(b)-(d): The spectral gap, BPS degeneracy, and Feynman diagram convergence questions are genuine open problems, correctly framed (assuming the admissibility bound is corrected). The Witten index claim in (c) is standard SUSY lore. (4) OP3 caveats (I) and (II): These correctly identify the two key obstacles to the single-coloring interpretation. (5) L2: The TV-as-PR-regularization discussion is correct. The cosmological constant formula with k = r-2 uses standard TV conventions. (6) L3: Correctly states that SUSY is present at ALL q and does not need recovery; what is recovered is algebraic simplifications. (7) The r -\u003e infinity section no longer references a 'SUSY obstruction,' which is a correct fix from the original version. OVERALL: The child node 1.4.4.1 contains a fully corrected version of this node. The parent 1.4.4 needs its ADMISSIBILITY CONSTRAINT, OP2(a), OP2(b), OP3, and L1 updated to match the child's corrections. The structural content (choice of open problems, caveats, erratum) is sound.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
