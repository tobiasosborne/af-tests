The q-parameter is FIXED while the representation labels grow. The quantum 6j symbol is computed via the q-Racah formula with REAL q.\n\nREGIME B (proven in literature): q = e^{2*pi*i/r} is a ROOT OF UNITY approaching 1 as r -\u003e infinity. The spins are proportional to r (bounded by Turaev-Viro admissibility). Both q and the spins change together. The quantum 6j symbol is evaluated at a COMPLEX q on the unit circle.\n\nThe geometric interpretations differ: In Regime B, the Gram matrix of the tetrahedron has entries cos(theta_ij) where the angles theta_ij are determined by the ratio of spins to r, giving a tetrahedron in hyperbolic/spherical/Euclidean geometry depending on the signature. In Regime A, there is no analogous geometric construction established in the literature.\n\nThe node erroneously transplants the proven Regime B result into the unproven Regime A setting. Even the notation is wrong: the Belletti-Yang formula uses (2*pi/r) not (1/n), because the natural scaling in the root-of-unity regime is with respect to r, not n.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
