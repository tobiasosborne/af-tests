However, 8 vertices each contributing [N]_q^{1/2} gives a product of [N]_q^{8/2} = [N]_q^4. Since [N]_q ~ exp(2j|log q|) for q \\!= 1, we get [N]_q^4 ~ exp(8j|log q|), NOT exp(4j|log q|). The discrepancy is a factor of 2 in the exponent: 8 * (1/2) * (2j|log q|) = 8j|log q|, not 4j|log q|. This is consistent with the classical case where N^4 appears as the vertex factor for the cube diagram (Draft.tex line 616), and [N]_q^4 is the natural q-analogue of N^4 = (2j+1)^4. The qualitative conclusion (exponential growth of non-melonic diagrams vs polynomial growth of melonic diagrams in case (b)) is unaffected by this factor-of-2 correction, so this is a minor quantitative issue.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
