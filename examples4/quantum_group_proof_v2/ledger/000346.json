CONDITION B (RACAH FORMULA WELL-DEFINEDNESS): j \u003c= (r-2)/3, equivalently r \u003e= 3j+2, ensuring that [3j+1]! in the triangle coefficient Delta(j,j,j) has no zero factors, so that the quantum 3j symbols C^j_q(m1,m2,m3) in the BLM supercharge are well-defined via the Racah formula. Since the BLM supercharge uses the (j,j,j) 3j symbol, Condition B is the OPERATIVE (stricter) constraint. This also coincides with the Turaev-Viro level truncation condition 3j \u003c= r-2 for the triple (j,j,j). Concretely for odd integer j: j=1 requires r \u003e= 5; j=3 requires r \u003e= 11; j=5 requires r \u003e= 17. When Condition B is satisfied: (a) the quantum dimension [2j+1]_q != 0 (Condition A is automatically satisfied since (r-2)/3 \u003c (r-2)/2 for r \u003e= 5); (b) the quantum 3j symbols C^j_q(m1,m2,m3) are well-defined (no division by zero in the Racah formula); (c) the supercharge Q_q and Hamiltonian H_q = {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} \u003e= 0 are well-defined operators on the Fock space. All three open problems below assume j is admissible in this sense (i.e., satisfies Condition B). As established in node 1.4.3, the N=2 SUSY structure (Q_q^2 = 0, H_q \u003e= 0, BPS ground states) is PRESERVED at root of unity for admissible j.\n\nDependencies: This node depends on node 1.4.3 (SUSY preservation and representation-theoretic constraints at root of unity), node 1.4.1 (Turaev-Viro state sum), node 1.4.2 (structural analogy between BLM diagrams and Boulatov GFT), and nodes 1.1-1.2 (the q=1 BLM model, referred to as Part I).\n\n(OP1) BLM-to-TV map: Is there a precise mathematical relationship between the BLM Feynman diagram expansion at root-of-unity q and Turaev-Viro topological invariants? A potential approach: embed the BLM model into a Boulatov-type GFT by promoting the fixed spin j to a dynamical variable summed over all admissible spins l \u003c= (r-2)/2. This would require: (a) defining a multi-spin generalization of BLM, noting that BLM uses FERMIONS while the standard Boulatov model uses a BOSONIC field on SU(2)^3 -- a fermionic GFT extension would be needed (the existing GFT literature includes fermionic tensor models, e.g., Ben Geloun-Bonzom 2011 on radiative corrections in colored tensor models, but a fermionic GFT specifically adapted for BLM embedding -- with the correct vertex structure matching quantum 3j symbols at fixed spin -- has not been constructed; the feasibility of such an extension remains an open question); (b) showing the resulting Feynman expansion produces the TV state sum; (c) understanding what the single-spin BLM model computes as a sector of the full GFT. None of these steps has been carried out. A further obstacle: restricting the admissible spins in the GFT sum (e.g., to odd integers only, matching BLM) would generically break the triangulation independence that makes TV a topological invariant, since triangulation independence relies on the completeness of the sum over all admissible representations.\n\n(OP2) Root-of-unity spectral and boundary behavior: The SUSY structure H_q = {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} \u003e= 0 is preserved at root of unity for admissible j \u003c= (r-2)/3 (node 1.4.3, Condition B). This does NOT mean the root-of-unity model is trivially identical to the q \u003e 0 real model. Genuine open problems include: (a) BOUNDARY BEHAVIOR: At the representation-admissibility boundary j = (r-2)/2 (Condition A, which is LESS strict than the operative Condition B), the quantum dimension [2j+1]_q = [r-1]_q = sin((r-1)*pi/r)/sin(pi/r) = 1, so the bubble identity normalization 1/[2j+1]_q is perfectly finite (equal to 1). However, [2j+2]_q = [r]_q = 0 at this boundary, which causes genuine complications: recoupling identities involving sums over intermediate spins up to j+1 (such as the Biedenharn-Elliott identity and orthogonality relations for 6j symbols) encounter vanishing quantum dimensions in their range, and quantum 6j symbols whose entries involve spins at or beyond the truncation bound may have singular Racah formula evaluations (quantum factorials [n]_q! with n \u003e= r have vanishing factors since [r]_q = 0). What is the behavior of the BLM spectrum and Feynman diagram expansion near this boundary? Is there a well-defined limiting procedure as j approaches the representation-admissibility boundary (r-2)/2? (Note: for j in the range (r-2)/3 \u003c j \u003c= (r-2)/2, the spin-j representation exists but the BLM supercharge is not well-defined via the Racah formula, so this question concerns a hypothetical extension of the BLM model beyond its operative admissibility domain.) (b) SPECTRAL GAP DEPENDENCE ON r: For fixed admissible j, how does the spectral gap of H_q = {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} depend on r? Does it remain bounded away from zero, or does it close as r decreases toward the admissibility bound 3j+2? (c) BPS DEGENERACY: The Witten index Tr((-1)^F) is a topological invariant of the SUSY algebra and should be independent of q. But the detailed BPS spectrum (not just the index) may change at root of unity -- are the BPS multiplicities the same as for q \u003e 0 real? (d) FEYNMAN DIAGRAM CONVERGENCE: The root-of-unity q-3j symbols are generically complex (not real), so individual Feynman diagram amplitudes are complex. Does the perturbative expansion retain its combinatorial interpretation? Are there cancellations or resummation phenomena specific to root of unity?\n\n(OP3) Spin content reconciliation: The BLM model uses only odd integer j \u003e= 1 as its spin parameter. The TV state sum uses all half-integer spins l = 0, 1/2, 1, ..., (r-2)/2. If a BLM-to-TV connection exists, it must account for this mismatch. One possibility: the BLM model at fixed odd integer j corresponds to a single-coloring sector of a TV-like state sum, where all edge labels in the triangulation equal j. For this single-coloring interpretation to be consistent, the coloring (j,j,j) must be TV-admissible. The TV admissibility conditions from node 1.4 are: (i) triangle inequality |a-b| \u003c= c \u003c= a+b (trivially satisfied for (j,j,j)), (ii) a+b+c is an integer (satisfied since 3j is an integer for integer j), and (iii) the LEVEL TRUNCATION condition a+b+c \u003c= r-2, which for (j,j,j) requires 3j \u003c= r-2, i.e., j \u003c= (r-2)/3. This level truncation condition COINCIDES with the BLM operative admissibility bound (Condition B, r \u003e= 3j+2) -- both require j \u003c= (r-2)/3. However, it is STRICTER than the representation-admissibility bound j \u003c= (r-2)/2 (Condition A). This means the single-coloring interpretation is automatically consistent for all BLM-admissible j: every j satisfying the operative BLM bound also satisfies the TV level truncation for (j,j,j). The range of representation-admissible but BLM-inadmissible spins splits into two regimes relative to TV admissibility: (REGIME I) j \u003c= (r-2)/3: The coloring (j,j,j) is TV-admissible AND j is BLM-admissible. The single-coloring sector interpretation is consistent at the level of admissibility. (REGIME II) (r-2)/3 \u003c j \u003c= (r-2)/2: The spin-j representation of U_q(su(2)) exists (Condition A is satisfied), but BOTH the TV level truncation for (j,j,j) AND the BLM Racah formula (Condition B) fail. Concrete example: r = 9, j = 3 (odd, satisfies j \u003c= 3.5 = (r-2)/2 so representation-admissible), but 3j = 9 \u003e 7 = r-2, so (3,3,3) is NOT TV-admissible, and [10]_q! in Delta(3,3,3) contains the zero factor [9]_q = [r]_q = 0. In Regime II the BLM supercharge itself is not well-defined, so the BLM-to-TV question does not arise. Additionally, even in Regime I, this interpretation requires two caveats: (I) a single-coloring sector of a TV state sum applied to a specific triangulation gives a single amplitude, while the BLM model produces a perturbative series summing over all Feynman diagram topologies -- the comparison must account for the sum over diagram topologies on the BLM side and triangulations on the TV side; (II) a TV state sum restricted to a single coloring is NOT triangulation-independent, so the single-coloring sector interpretation does not yield a topological invariant. The precise nature of the BLM-to-TV relationship remains open.\n\nTHE r -\u003e INFINITY LIMIT: As r -\u003e infinity, q = exp(2*pi*i/r) -\u003e 1. Three things happen:\n\n(L1) REPRESENTATION TRUNCATION DISAPPEARS: The spin truncation bound (r-2)/2 -\u003e infinity and the Racah admissibility bound (r-2)/3 -\u003e infinity, so both conditions A and B become vacuous for any fixed j. In this limit, q -\u003e 1 and all q-deformed quantities converge to their classical q=1 values: quantum dimensions [2l+1]_q -\u003e 2l+1, quantum 3j and 6j symbols approach their classical (real-valued) counterparts, and the truncated representation category of U_q(su(2)) at root of unity is replaced by the unrestricted classical representation theory of su(2) (i.e., the q=1 case). In particular, the root-of-unity-specific complications (boundary effects from [r]_q = 0, level truncation) vanish.\n\n(L2) TV REGULARIZATION IS REMOVED: The Turaev-Viro state sum TV_r(M) provides a finite regularization of the (divergent) Ponzano-Regge partition function PR(M). As r -\u003e infinity, the regularization is removed: the truncation of the spin sum is lifted and the quantum dimensions [2l+1]_q -\u003e 2l+1. The PR sum sum_{colorings} prod_{edges} (-1)^{2l}(2l+1) prod_{tetrahedra} {6j} is formally divergent for closed 3-manifolds and requires independent regularization (the TV sum at finite r IS the standard regularization). The cosmological constant Lambda = 4*pi^2/(r-2)^2 = 4*pi^2/k^2 + O(k^{-4}) (where k = r-2 is the Chern-Simons level in standard TV conventions) tends to 0, recovering flat 3D Euclidean gravity.\n\n(L3) BLM MODEL RECOVERY: For the BLM model with fixed admissible j, as q -\u003e 1: the q-3j symbols C^j_q -\u003e C^j (real Clebsch-Gordan coefficients), the supercharge Q_q -\u003e Q (the q=1 supercharge of Part I, nodes 1.1-1.2), and the Hamiltonian H_q -\u003e H = {Q, Q^dagger} of the original BLM SUSY quantum mechanics. The SUSY structure H_q \u003e= 0 is present at ALL values of q (including roots of unity, per node 1.4.3) and does not need to be recovered -- what is recovered in the q -\u003e 1 limit is the specific algebraic simplifications of the q=1 case (reality of all coefficients, absence of truncation constraints). The BLM model parameter j remains fixed throughout this limit; it does NOT scale with r. The limit therefore does not involve any thermodynamic or continuum limit in the BLM model itself.\n\nERRATUM: The original version of this node contained OP2 asking whether the q-BLM model can be given a consistent QM interpretation at root of unity, presupposing that SUSY breaks. This was based on the false premise (inherited from the original 1.4.3) that {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} can have negative eigenvalues at root of unity. As corrected in node 1.4.3, {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} \u003e= 0 is a tautological consequence of the definition of the Hilbert space adjoint and holds for ALL q. The original OP2 three proposed remedies -- (a) modifying the inner product, (b) using Q^2=0 cohomologically without H \u003e= 0, (c) restricting to real q-3j symbols -- were all addressing a non-problem. The revised OP2 above identifies the GENUINE open problems at root of unity, which are representation-theoretic and spectral in nature. The r -\u003e infinity section has also been corrected to remove the false reference to a SUSY obstruction that disappears as q -\u003e 1. Additionally, OP2(a) originally claimed that 1/[2j+1]_q diverges at j = (r-2)/2; this was false since [2j+1]_q = [r-1]_q = 1 at this boundary. The corrected OP2(a) identifies the genuine boundary mechanism: [2j+2]_q = [r]_q = 0, which affects recoupling identities and 6j symbol evaluations near the truncation bound.\n\nERRATUM (v5, admissibility bound correction): The previous version of this node stated the operative admissibility bound in the preamble as \"j \u003c= (r-2)/2, equivalently r \u003e= 2j+3.\" This was incorrect: the bound j \u003c= (r-2)/2 is Condition A (representation admissibility), which is NECESSARY but NOT SUFFICIENT for the BLM model. The BLM supercharge requires the (j,j,j) quantum 3j symbol, whose Racah formula involves [3j+1]! in the denominator; this imposes the stricter Condition B: j \u003c= (r-2)/3, equivalently r \u003e= 3j+2. Counterexample to the old bound: j=3, r=9 satisfies r \u003e= 2(3)+3 = 9 but NOT r \u003e= 3(3)+2 = 11; at r=9, [9]_q = [r]_q = 0 appears as a factor in [10]_q! = [3j+1]!, making Delta(3,3,3) undefined. This erratum corrects the preamble, OP2(b) (which referenced \"admissibility bound 2j+3\"), OP3 (which incorrectly described TV level truncation as stricter than BLM admissibility -- they coincide at j \u003c= (r-2)/3), and L1 (which now references both bounds becoming vacuous as r -\u003e infinity). The body's analysis of Racah formula constraints was already correct.","new_statement":"Step 1.4.4 (Open problems and the r -\u003e infinity limit): This node discusses open problems for the q-BLM model at root of unity q = exp(2*pi*i/r) and the recovery of the q=1 model in the r -\u003e infinity limit.\n\nADMISSIBILITY CONSTRAINT (prerequisite for all that follows): At q = exp(2*pi*i/r), the BLM model with spin parameter j (odd integer, j \u003e= 1) is subject to two conditions of increasing strength: CONDITION A (REPRESENTATION ADMISSIBILITY): j \u003c= (r-2)/2, equivalently r \u003e= 2j+2, ensuring [2j+1]_q != 0 so that the spin-j representation of U_q(su(2)) is well-defined.

A potential approach: embed the BLM model into a Boulatov-type GFT by promoting the fixed spin j to a dynamical variable summed over all admissible spins l \u003c= (r-2)/2. This would require: (a) defining a multi-spin generalization of BLM, noting that BLM uses FERMIONS while the standard Boulatov model uses a BOSONIC field on SU(2)^3 -- a fermionic GFT extension would be needed (the existing GFT literature includes colored tensor models with bosonic fields, e.g., Ben Geloun-Bonzom 2011 (arXiv:1101.4294) on radiative corrections in the bosonic Boulatov-Ooguri model, and more recently fermionic tensor field theories in the SYK context, e.g., Ben Geloun-Rivasseau 2017 (arXiv:1711.05967) on a renormalizable SYK-type tensor field theory, but a fermionic GFT on SU(2)^3 specifically adapted for BLM embedding -- with the correct vertex structure matching quantum 3j symbols at fixed spin -- has not been constructed; no such specific construction exists in the literature and the feasibility of such an extension remains an open question); (b) showing the resulting Feynman expansion produces the TV state sum; (c) understanding what the single-spin BLM model computes as a sector of the full GFT.

A further obstacle: restricting the admissible spins in the GFT sum (e.g., to odd integers only, matching BLM) would generically break the triangulation independence that makes TV a topological invariant, since triangulation independence relies on the completeness of the sum over all admissible representations.\n\n(OP2) Root-of-unity spectral and boundary behavior: The SUSY structure H_q = {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} \u003e= 0 is preserved at root of unity for admissible j \u003c= (r-2)/3 (node 1.4.3, Condition B). This does NOT mean the root-of-unity model is trivially identical to the q \u003e 0 real model. Genuine open problems include: (a) BOUNDARY BEHAVIOR: At the representation-admissibility boundary j = (r-2)/2 (Condition A, which is LESS strict than the operative Condition B), the quantum dimension [2j+1]_q = [r-1]_q = sin((r-1)*pi/r)/sin(pi/r) = 1, so the bubble identity normalization 1/[2j+1]_q is perfectly finite (equal to 1). However, [2j+2]_q = [r]_q = 0 at this boundary, which causes genuine complications: recoupling identities involving sums over intermediate spins up to j+1 (such as the Biedenharn-Elliott identity and orthogonality relations for 6j symbols) encounter vanishing quantum dimensions in their range, and quantum 6j symbols whose entries involve spins at or beyond the truncation bound may have singular Racah formula evaluations (quantum factorials [n]_q! with n \u003e= r have vanishing factors since [r]_q = 0). What is the behavior of the BLM spectrum and Feynman diagram expansion near this boundary? Is there a well-defined limiting procedure as j approaches the representation-admissibility boundary (r-2)/2? (Note: for j in the range (r-2)/3 \u003c j \u003c= (r-2)/2, the spin-j representation exists but the BLM supercharge is not well-defined via the Racah formula, so this question concerns a hypothetical extension of the BLM model beyond its operative admissibility domain.) (b) SPECTRAL GAP DEPENDENCE ON r: For fixed admissible j, how does the spectral gap of H_q = {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} depend on r? Does it remain bounded away from zero, or does it close as r decreases toward the admissibility bound 3j+2? (c) BPS DEGENERACY: The Witten index Tr((-1)^F) is a topological invariant of the SUSY algebra and should be independent of q. But the detailed BPS spectrum (not just the index) may change at root of unity -- are the BPS multiplicities the same as for q \u003e 0 real? (d) PERTURBATIVE EXPANSION AT ROOT OF UNITY: For admissible j satisfying Condition B (r \u003e= 3j+2), the q-3j symbols C^j_q(m1,m2,m3) are REAL. This follows from the Racah formula: at q = exp(2*pi*i/r), the quantum integer [n]_q = sin(n*pi/r)/sin(pi/r) is real for all integer n. Under Condition B, all arguments n appearing in the quantum factorials of the Racah formula satisfy 1 \u003c= n \u003c= 3j+1 \u003c r, so sin(n*pi/r) \u003e 0 for all such n, making every [n]_q strictly positive real. Consequently all quantum factorials [n]_q! are products of positive reals, the triangle coefficient Delta(j,j,j) = sqrt([j]_q!^3/[3j+1]_q!) is positive real, and the Racah sum (involving ratios of positive quantum factorials with (-1)^z phases) produces real values. Therefore individual Feynman diagram amplitudes in the q-BLM model are REAL for admissible j. Despite this reality, genuine open questions for the perturbative expansion at root of unity remain: (d.i) WEIGHT MODIFICATION: The q-deformed Feynman diagram weights differ from their q=1 counterparts -- even though both are real, the specific numerical values change with q, potentially affecting convergence properties of the perturbative series. Do the q-dependent weights (which are algebraic numbers at root of unity) lead to better or worse convergence than the q=1 weights? (d.ii) FINITE TRUNCATION EFFECTS: The representation category at root of unity contains only finitely many admissible spins (j \u003c= (r-2)/3 for BLM). For multi-spin generalizations relevant to OP1, this finite truncation imposes hard cutoffs on internal spin sums in Feynman diagrams. Does this finite truncation provide a natural regularization of the perturbative expansion, analogous to how TV regularizes Ponzano-Regge? (d.iii) SIGN STRUCTURE: While q-3j symbols are real for admissible j, the (-1)^z alternating signs in the Racah formula mean individual q-3j symbols can be NEGATIVE. The sign pattern of q-3j symbols at root of unity may differ qualitatively from the q=1 sign pattern, potentially affecting cancellations between Feynman diagrams. Is there an analog of the sign problem in this setting?\n\n(OP3) Spin content reconciliation: The BLM model uses only odd integer j \u003e= 1 as its spin parameter. The TV state sum uses all half-integer spins l = 0, 1/2, 1, ..., (r-2)/2. If a BLM-to-TV connection exists, it must account for this mismatch. One possibility: the BLM model at fixed odd integer j corresponds to a single-coloring sector of a TV-like state sum, where all edge labels in the triangulation equal j. For this single-coloring interpretation to be consistent, the coloring (j,j,j) must be TV-admissible. The TV admissibility conditions from node 1.4 are: (i) triangle inequality |a-b| \u003c= c \u003c= a+b (trivially satisfied for (j,j,j)), (ii) a+b+c is an integer (satisfied since 3j is an integer for integer j), and (iii) the LEVEL TRUNCATION condition a+b+c \u003c= r-2, which for (j,j,j) requires 3j \u003c= r-2, i.e., j \u003c= (r-2)/3. This level truncation condition COINCIDES with the BLM operative admissibility bound (Condition B, r \u003e= 3j+2) -- both require j \u003c= (r-2)/3. This coincidence is exact and not accidental: both conditions arise from the same underlying constraint that [3j+1]_q! must be nonzero (in BLM, for the Racah formula denominator; in TV, for the 6j symbol normalization). Consequently, the two-regime analysis is straightforward: (REGIME I = the entire BLM-admissible range) j \u003c= (r-2)/3: The coloring (j,j,j) is simultaneously TV-admissible AND BLM-admissible. Every BLM-admissible spin automatically has a consistent TV single-coloring interpretation at the level of admissibility conditions. (REGIME II = BLM-inadmissible, discussed for completeness only) (r-2)/3 \u003c j \u003c= (r-2)/2: The spin-j representation of U_q(su(2)) exists (Condition A is satisfied), but BOTH the TV level truncation for (j,j,j) AND the BLM Racah formula (Condition B) fail simultaneously. The BLM supercharge itself is not well-defined in this range, so the BLM-to-TV question does not arise. Regime II is discussed only to explain why naive extension of the BLM model beyond the Racah bound fails: it simultaneously violates TV admissibility. Concrete example: r = 9, j = 3 (odd, satisfies j \u003c= 3.5 = (r-2)/2 so representation-admissible), but 3j = 9 \u003e 7 = r-2, so (3,3,3) is NOT TV-admissible, and [10]_q! = [3j+1]_q! in Delta(3,3,3) contains the zero factor [9]_q = [r]_q = 0. Even in Regime I, the single-coloring interpretation requires two caveats: (I) a single-coloring sector of a TV state sum applied to a specific triangulation gives a single amplitude, while the BLM model produces a perturbative series summing over all Feynman diagram topologies -- the comparison must account for the sum over diagram topologies on the BLM side and triangulations on the TV side; (II) a TV state sum restricted to a single coloring is NOT triangulation-independent, so the single-coloring sector interpretation does not yield a topological invariant. The precise nature of the BLM-to-TV relationship remains open.\n\nTHE r -\u003e INFINITY LIMIT: As r -\u003e infinity, q = exp(2*pi*i/r) -\u003e 1. Three things happen:\n\n(L1) REPRESENTATION TRUNCATION DISAPPEARS: The spin truncation bound (r-2)/2 -\u003e infinity and the Racah admissibility bound (r-2)/3 -\u003e infinity, so both conditions A and B become vacuous for any fixed j. In this limit, q -\u003e 1 and all q-deformed quantities converge to their classical q=1 values: quantum dimensions [2l+1]_q -\u003e 2l+1, quantum 3j and 6j symbols approach their classical (real-valued) counterparts, and the truncated representation category of U_q(su(2)) at root of unity is replaced by the unrestricted classical representation theory of su(2) (i.e., the q=1 case). In particular, the root-of-unity-specific complications (boundary effects from [r]_q = 0, level truncation) vanish.\n\n(L2) TV REGULARIZATION IS REMOVED: The Turaev-Viro state sum TV_r(M) provides a finite regularization of the (divergent) Ponzano-Regge partition function PR(M). As r -\u003e infinity, the regularization is removed: the truncation of the spin sum is lifted and the quantum dimensions [2l+1]_q -\u003e 2l+1. The PR sum sum_{colorings} prod_{edges} (-1)^{2l}(2l+1) prod_{tetrahedra} {6j} is formally divergent for closed 3-manifolds and requires independent regularization (the TV sum at finite r IS the standard regularization). The cosmological constant Lambda = 4*pi^2/(r-2)^2 = 4*pi^2/k^2 + O(k^{-4}) (where k = r-2 is the Chern-Simons level in standard TV conventions) tends to 0, recovering flat 3D Euclidean gravity.\n\n(L3) BLM MODEL RECOVERY: For the BLM model with fixed admissible j, as q -\u003e 1: the q-3j symbols C^j_q -\u003e C^j (real Clebsch-Gordan coefficients), the supercharge Q_q -\u003e Q (the q=1 supercharge of Part I, nodes 1.1-1.2), and the Hamiltonian H_q -\u003e H = {Q, Q^dagger} of the original BLM SUSY quantum mechanics. The SUSY structure H_q \u003e= 0 is present at ALL values of q (including roots of unity, per node 1.4.3) and does not need to be recovered -- what is recovered in the q -\u003e 1 limit is the specific algebraic simplifications of the q=1 case (reality of all coefficients, absence of truncation constraints). The BLM model parameter j remains fixed throughout this limit; it does NOT scale with r. The limit therefore does not involve any thermodynamic or continuum limit in the BLM model itself.\n\nERRATUM: The original version of this node contained OP2 asking whether the q-BLM model can be given a consistent QM interpretation at root of unity, presupposing that SUSY breaks. This was based on the false premise (inherited from the original 1.4.3) that {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} can have negative eigenvalues at root of unity. As corrected in node 1.4.3, {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} \u003e= 0 is a tautological consequence of the definition of the Hilbert space adjoint and holds for ALL q. The original OP2 three proposed remedies -- (a) modifying the inner product, (b) using Q^2=0 cohomologically without H \u003e= 0, (c) restricting to real q-3j symbols -- were all addressing a non-problem. The revised OP2 above identifies the GENUINE open problems at root of unity, which are representation-theoretic and spectral in nature. The r -\u003e infinity section has also been corrected to remove the false reference to a SUSY obstruction that disappears as q -\u003e 1. Additionally, OP2(a) originally claimed that 1/[2j+1]_q diverges at j = (r-2)/2; this was false since [2j+1]_q = [r-1]_q = 1 at this boundary. The corrected OP2(a) identifies the genuine boundary mechanism: [2j+2]_q = [r]_q = 0, which affects recoupling identities and 6j symbol evaluations near the truncation bound.\n\nERRATUM (v5, admissibility bound correction): The previous version of this node stated the operative admissibility bound in the preamble as \"j \u003c= (r-2)/2, equivalently r \u003e= 2j+3.\" This was incorrect: the bound j \u003c= (r-2)/2 is Condition A (representation admissibility), which is NECESSARY but NOT SUFFICIENT for the BLM model. The BLM supercharge requires the (j,j,j) quantum 3j symbol, whose Racah formula involves [3j+1]! in the denominator; this imposes the stricter Condition B: j \u003c= (r-2)/3, equivalently r \u003e= 3j+2. Counterexample to the old bound: j=3, r=9 satisfies r \u003e= 2(3)+3 = 9 but NOT r \u003e= 3(3)+2 = 11; at r=9, [9]_q = [r]_q = 0 appears as a factor in [10]_q! = [3j+1]!, making Delta(3,3,3) undefined. This erratum corrects the preamble, OP2(b) (which referenced \"admissibility bound 2j+3\"), OP3 (which incorrectly described TV level truncation as stricter than BLM admissibility -- they coincide at j \u003c= (r-2)/3), and L1 (which now references both bounds becoming vacuous as r -\u003e infinity). The body's analysis of Racah formula constraints was already correct.\n\nERRATUM (v6, OP2(d) correction and reference fixes): The previous version of OP2(d) stated \"The root-of-unity q-3j symbols are generically complex (not real), so individual Feynman diagram amplitudes are complex.\" This was FALSE for admissible j satisfying Condition B (r \u003e= 3j+2). Proof of reality: [n]_q = sin(n*pi/r)/sin(pi/r) is real for all integer n; under Condition B, all n in the Racah formula satisfy 1 \u003c= n \u003c= 3j+1 \u003c r, so sin(n*pi/r) \u003e 0, making [n]_q positive real; all quantum factorials are products of positive reals; Delta(j,j,j) = sqrt(positive real) is positive real; the Racah sum is a sum of real terms. The corrected OP2(d) identifies genuine open questions: weight modification under q-deformation, finite truncation effects on perturbative expansion, and the sign structure of real q-3j symbols. Additionally, OP1 previously cited \"Ben Geloun-Bonzom 2011 on radiative corrections in colored tensor models\" as a fermionic GFT reference; the paper (arXiv:1101.4294) is actually about the BOSONIC Boulatov-Ooguri model. The corrected OP1 cites it accurately as a bosonic colored tensor model and adds Ben Geloun-Rivasseau 2017 (arXiv:1711.05967) as a fermionic tensor field theory reference. OP3 has been clarified to state upfront that the BLM and TV admissibility coincidence is exact, with Regime II discussed only for completeness.","owner":"prover-1441-v6"}
