However, the conjectural asymptotic formula lim_{n-\u003einf} (1/n) log |{nj}_q| = V(q) involves a limit, and the constraint V(q) = V(q^{-1}) assumes the limit exists and is unique. If the limit does not exist (e.g., oscillatory behavior), the symmetry constraint applies to the 6j symbol at each finite value but not necessarily to any putative exponential growth rate. This is a theoretical subtlety worth noting: the symmetry argument constrains any exponential growth rate IF it exists, but does not by itself guarantee that such a rate is well-defined. The node's logic is correct as stated (it says 'any exponential growth rate V(q) MUST satisfy V(q) = V(q^{-1})'), but it may be worth adding 'provided the limit exists' for completeness.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
