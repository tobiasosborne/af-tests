This creates a logical dependency on node 1.4.3, yet no dependency is declared. If node 1.4.3's claims are revised (as they should be, given the critical SUSY error), the r -\u003e infinity discussion would need updating.\n\nThe node should either:\n(a) Declare node 1.4.3 as a dependency, or\n(b) Be self-contained by stating the relevant facts from 1.4.3 directly (which would then be subject to the same corrections needed for 1.4.3 itself).\n\nAdditionally, the node references 'Part I (q=1 BLM model)' for the fixed-j limit but does not specify which node this corresponds to (presumably 1.1 or 1.2). These implicit dependencies should be made explicit.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
