The PR sum is divergent (it sums over infinitely many spins), so TV_r does not 'approach' PR in any standard limit. Rather, TV_r is a REGULARIZATION of PR, and in the formal limit r -\u003e infinity the regularization is removed. The relationship is better stated as: TV_r provides a finite regularization of the (divergent) PR sum, parametrized by the root of unity order r.\n\n(2) The Ponzano-Regge formula written as 'sum_{colorings} prod [2l+1] prod {6j}' omits the vertex normalization factors and the specific weight conventions. The correct PR amplitude includes a factor of (-1)^{2j}(2j+1) per edge (quantum dimension at q=1) and the Racah-Wigner 6j symbol per tetrahedron, plus combinatorial signs.\n\n(3) The cosmological constant formula Lambda = 4*pi^2/(r-2)^2 -\u003e 0 is stated without noting the convention subtleties raised in challenges on nodes 1.4 and 1.4.1 (whether (r-2) is the correct identification with the Chern-Simons level k). The correct identification depends on conventions: if k = r-2 (standard TV convention), then Lambda = 4*pi^2/k^2 + O(k^{-4}) gives Lambda ~ 4*pi^2/(r-2)^2 which is correct.\n\nThese are precision issues that do not affect the qualitative correctness of the limit.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
