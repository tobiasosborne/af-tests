Both share the same content hash (7f684087e2977890984cd4ef7f2b6a1ea82d26dd6da103e8121c729b96fcf2a2). This node serves no structural purpose in the proof tree. The parent node 1.4 already has four substantive children (1.4.1 through 1.4.4) that decompose parts (A), (B), (C), and the open problems/limit discussion respectively. Node 1.4.5 adds nothing beyond what 1.4 already states. It should be archived to avoid confusion, prevent redundant verification work, and maintain proof tree hygiene. A child node that merely restates its parent verbatim is a structural defect, not a mathematical contribution.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
