For q = exp(2*pi*i/r) with r a positive odd integer, and 6-tuples (j1,...,j6) satisfying Turaev-Viro admissibility (each ji \u003c (r-2)/2), scaling all spins proportionally with r, the quantum 6j symbol has exponential asymptotics: lim_{r -\u003e inf, r odd} (2*pi/r) * ln|{j1 j2 j3; j4 j5 j6}_{q=exp(2*pi*i/r)}| = Vol(Delta_hyp), where Vol(Delta_hyp) is the volume of the generalized hyperbolic tetrahedron whose dihedral angles are determined by the ratios of spins to r via the Gram matrix construction. This volume can be positive (exponential growth), negative (exponential decay), or zero, depending on the specific geometric configuration of the tetrahedron, NOT simply on the value of q.

For fixed real q \u003e 0, q != 1, with all spins scaling as j_i -\u003e n*j_i and n -\u003e infinity, Taylor-Woodward (Selecta Math 2005, Section 9) STATE WITHOUT PROOF that the asymptotics should be governed by hyperbolic tetrahedron volumes. This remains an OPEN CONJECTURE. No rigorous proof exists in the literature for this regime.\n\n(C) q \u003c-\u003e q^{-1} SYMMETRY CONSTRAINT. The quantum integer [n]_q = (q^n - q^{-n})/(q - q^{-1}) satisfies [n]_q = [n]_{q^{-1}}. Since the 6j symbol is a rational function of q-factorials, {6j}_q = {6j}_{q^{-1}}. ANY asymptotic formula for real q must respect this: the exponential growth rate (if it exists) is invariant under q -\u003e q^{-1}. In particular, it CANNOT be positive for q \u003e 1 and negative for 0 \u003c q \u003c 1. If exponential growth occurs at rate f(q) for some q \u003e 1, then f(q^{-1}) = f(q), so the SAME growth occurs for q^{-1} in (0,1).\n\n(D) REGIME DISTINCTION. Regimes (A) and (B) are qualitatively different: In (A), q = exp(2*pi*i/r) is complex on the unit circle, both q and spins scale with r, and dihedral angles come from spin/r ratios. In (B), q is real and fixed, only spins grow, and no Gram matrix construction is established. For real q, the relevant algebraic structure is the modular double of U_q(sl(2,R)) (Faddeev 1999, Ponsot-Teschner 2001), whose b-6j symbols have semiclassical asymptotics governed by hyperbolic volumes (Teschner-Vartanov 2014), but this involves continuous — not finite-dimensional — representations.\n\nSTATUS: The proven root-of-unity results (A) motivate the CONJECTURE that exponential 6j asymptotics persist for real q. This conjecture, if true, would imply breakdown of melonic dominance. The fixed-real-q asymptotics required for the q-BLM model remain unproven.","owner":"prover-1.3.1"}
