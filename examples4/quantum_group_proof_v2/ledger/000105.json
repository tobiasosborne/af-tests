At q = exp(2*pi*i/r), they are generically complex. This has three consequences for the BLM model structure:\n\n(i) NILPOTENCY SURVIVES: Q_q^2 = 0 holds at root of unity. The proof uses only the total antisymmetry of C^j_q under column permutations of the 3j symbol, which is an algebraic identity valid for all q (including roots of unity), combined with the Grassmann property of fermions. No reality of coefficients is needed.\n\n(ii) POSITIVE SEMI-DEFINITENESS FAILS: For q \u003e 0 real, Q_q^dagger (the Fock-space adjoint) has the same matrix elements as Q_q with complex conjugated coefficients, which equals Q_q since coefficients are real. At root of unity, define Q_q^bar by complex conjugating the 3j coefficients: Q_q^bar = (1/3!)sqrt(2JN) sum C^j_q(m1,m2,m3)^* psi^dagger_{m1} psi^dagger_{m2} psi^dagger_{m3}. The Fock-space adjoint Q_q^dagger involves BOTH conjugating coefficients AND reversing the Grassmann ordering, giving Q_q^dagger = -Q_q^bar (with the sign from fermion reordering). The operator H_naive = Q_q * Q_q^bar + Q_q^bar * Q_q involves Q_q^bar which is NOT the Fock adjoint. The true {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} = -{Q_q, Q_q^bar} and its eigenvalues need not be non-negative. Explicit example: for the simplest case j=1 (N=3), the 3j symbols at q = exp(2*pi*i/5) are complex, and the spectrum of {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} includes negative eigenvalues.\n\n(iii) BPS STRUCTURE LOST: Without H_q \u003e= 0, the notion of BPS states (ker H_q as ground states) loses its physical meaning. The kernel of {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} is still well-defined as a vector space, but states in it are not guaranteed to be lowest-energy. The Witten index computation from node 1.3.5 (which uses only fermion number, not coupling coefficients) gives a formal answer, but it does not have the usual SUSY interpretation at root of unity.\n\nCONCLUSION: The root-of-unity q-BLM model retains Q_q^2 = 0 (a cohomological structure) and the combinatorial Feynman diagram expansion, but is NOT an N=2 SUSY quantum mechanics. It should be viewed as a formal algebraic/diagrammatic framework whose relation to quantum gravity is through the shared recoupling symbols, not through a well-defined quantum mechanical Hamiltonian.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"f6c423dfbf683f8230b380197c43818da0845321de23818087ee9bf15be3255e","created":"2026-02-11T20:05:00.684194169Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
