This is incorrect. Using the convention q = exp(2*pi*i/r) with [n]_q = sin(n*pi/r)/sin(pi/r), at j = (r-2)/2 we get [2j+1]_q = [r-1]_q = sin((r-1)*pi/r)/sin(pi/r) = sin(pi/r)/sin(pi/r) = 1. Therefore 1/[2j+1]_q = 1 at j = (r-2)/2, which is perfectly finite, NOT divergent. The PARENT NODE 1.4 section (C5) explicitly confirms this: 'At the boundary j = (r-2)/2, the quantum dimension [2j+2]_q = [r]_q = 0 while [2j+1]_q remains nonzero for admissible j.' So node 1.4.4 contradicts its own parent. What IS true is that [2j+2]_q = [r]_q = 0 at the boundary, which is relevant for certain 6j symbol expressions, but this is NOT the same as 1/[2j+1]_q diverging. The node conflates [2j+1]_q (which equals 1 at the boundary) with [r]_q = [2j+2]_q (which equals 0). The claim that 'the quantum 6j symbols develop singularities' near the boundary may be true for separate reasons (e.g., 6j symbols involving spins near the truncation bound may involve quantum factorials with vanishing factors), but the specific mechanism cited -- 1/[2j+1]_q divergence -- is wrong.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
