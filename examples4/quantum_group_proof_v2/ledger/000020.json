For q ≠ 1, ker(H_q) = ker(Q_q) ∩ ker(Q_q†) may change dimension. Two sub-questions: (A) Q_q annihilation of maximal-spin states IS topological (selection rule m1+m2+m3=0 blocks destruction of highest-m fermions, independent of q). (B) Q_q† annihilation is NOT topological — it requires a delicate numerical cancellation involving the bubble identity (1/(2j+1) classically, 1/[2j+1]_q for q≠1) and sign-sector symmetries of 3j symbols. This cancellation is UNPROVEN for q ≠ 1. Additionally, no wall-crossing analysis exists: the Witten index W(r) = omega^{-N/2}(1-omega^r)^N with N=2j+1 IS q-independent (it depends only on fermion count, not couplings), but the unsigned BPS degeneracy D^BPS is not protected by the index alone. Whether D^BPS_q = D^BPS for all q \u003e 0 is an open question requiring either explicit computation or a spectral gap argument.
