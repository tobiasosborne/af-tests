{"type":"node_validated","timestamp":"2026-02-11T20:22:37.301139117Z","node_id":"1.3","note":"Node 1.3 ACCEPTED after thorough verification. Two non-blocking challenges raised (ch-0253dbe17dd minor, ch-c9be0438ec7 note). The amended node correctly separates PROVEN root-of-unity results from CONJECTURAL fixed-real-q extensions, properly states q\u003c-\u003eq^{-1} symmetry, accurately cites references within their scope, and qualifies all conditional consequences. Draft.tex cross-references (lines 556, 612-622) verified. Volume Conjecture correctly labeled as analogy, not equivalence. Previous 4 critical/major challenges all adequately addressed by amendment."}
