{"type":"node_amended","timestamp":"2026-02-12T13:40:59.419950143Z","node_id":"1.4.4","previous_statement":"Step 1.4.4 (Open problems and the r -\u003e infinity limit): This node discusses open problems for the q-BLM model at root of unity q = exp(2*pi*i/r) and the recovery of the q=1 model in the r -\u003e infinity limit.\n\nADMISSIBILITY CONSTRAINT (prerequisite for all that follows): At q = exp(2*pi*i/r), the BLM model with spin parameter j (odd integer, j \u003e= 1) requires j \u003c= (r-2)/2, equivalently r \u003e= 2j+3. This ensures: (a) the quantum dimension [2j+1]_q != 0, so the bubble identity normalization is non-singular; (b) the quantum 3j symbols C^j_q(m1,m2,m3) are well-defined (no division by zero in the Racah formula); (c) the supercharge Q_q and Hamiltonian H_q = {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} \u003e= 0 are well-defined operators on the Fock space. All three open problems below assume j is admissible in this sense. As established in node 1.4.3, the N=2 SUSY structure (Q_q^2 = 0, H_q \u003e= 0, BPS ground states) is PRESERVED at root of unity for admissible j.\n\nDependencies: This node depends on node 1.4.3 (SUSY preservation and representation-theoretic constraints at root of unity), node 1.4.1 (Turaev-Viro state sum), node 1.4.2 (structural analogy between BLM diagrams and Boulatov GFT), and nodes 1.1-1.2 (the q=1 BLM model, referred to as Part I).\n\n(OP1) BLM-to-TV map: Is there a precise mathematical relationship between the BLM Feynman diagram expansion at root-of-unity q and Turaev-Viro topological invariants? A potential approach: embed the BLM model into a Boulatov-type GFT by promoting the fixed spin j to a dynamical variable summed over all admissible spins l \u003c= (r-2)/2. This would require: (a) defining a multi-spin generalization of BLM, noting that BLM uses FERMIONS while the standard Boulatov model uses a BOSONIC field on SU(2)^3 -- a fermionic GFT extension would be needed (cf. Geloun-Bonzom for fermionic GFT frameworks); (b) showing the resulting Feynman expansion produces the TV state sum; (c) understanding what the single-spin BLM model computes as a sector of the full GFT. None of these steps has been carried out. A further obstacle: restricting the admissible spins in the GFT sum (e.g., to odd integers only, matching BLM) would generically break the triangulation independence that makes TV a topological invariant, since triangulation independence relies on the completeness of the sum over all admissible representations.\n\n(OP2) Root-of-unity spectral and boundary behavior: The SUSY structure H_q = {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} \u003e= 0 is preserved at root of unity for admissible j \u003c (r-2)/2 (node 1.4.3). This does NOT mean the root-of-unity model is trivially identical to the q \u003e 0 real model. Genuine open problems include: (a) BOUNDARY BEHAVIOR: As j approaches the admissibility bound (r-2)/2, the quantum 6j symbols develop singularities and the bubble identity normalization 1/[2j+1]_q diverges at j = (r-2)/2. What is the behavior of the BLM spectrum and Feynman diagram expansion near this boundary? Is there a well-defined limiting procedure? (b) SPECTRAL GAP DEPENDENCE ON r: For fixed admissible j, how does the spectral gap of H_q = {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} depend on r? Does it remain bounded away from zero, or does it close as r decreases toward the admissibility bound 2j+3? (c) BPS DEGENERACY: The Witten index Tr((-1)^F) is a topological invariant of the SUSY algebra and should be independent of q. But the detailed BPS spectrum (not just the index) may change at root of unity -- are the BPS multiplicities the same as for q \u003e 0 real? (d) FEYNMAN DIAGRAM CONVERGENCE: The root-of-unity q-3j symbols are generically complex (not real), so individual Feynman diagram amplitudes are complex. Does the perturbative expansion retain its combinatorial interpretation? Are there cancellations or resummation phenomena specific to root of unity?\n\n(OP3) Spin content reconciliation: The BLM model uses only odd integer j \u003e= 1 as its spin parameter. The TV state sum uses all half-integer spins l = 0, 1/2, 1, ..., (r-2)/2. If a BLM-to-TV connection exists, it must account for this mismatch. One possibility: the BLM model at fixed odd integer j corresponds to a single-coloring sector of a TV-like state sum, where all edge labels in the triangulation equal j. This is consistent at the level of admissibility (the triangle inequality (j,j,j) is trivially satisfied, and 3j is an integer for integer j). However, this interpretation requires two caveats: (I) a single-coloring sector of a TV state sum applied to a specific triangulation gives a single amplitude, while the BLM model produces a perturbative series summing over all Feynman diagram topologies -- the comparison must account for the sum over diagram topologies on the BLM side and triangulations on the TV side; (II) a TV state sum restricted to a single coloring is NOT triangulation-independent, so the single-coloring sector interpretation does not yield a topological invariant. The precise nature of the BLM-to-TV relationship remains open.\n\nTHE r -\u003e INFINITY LIMIT: As r -\u003e infinity, q = exp(2*pi*i/r) -\u003e 1. Three things happen:\n\n(L1) REPRESENTATION TRUNCATION DISAPPEARS: The spin truncation bound (r-2)/2 -\u003e infinity, so the admissibility constraint j \u003c= (r-2)/2 becomes vacuous for any fixed j. The full representation theory of U_q(su(2)) at generic q is recovered. In particular, all quantum 3j and 6j symbols become real (as q -\u003e 1 through roots of unity), and the root-of-unity-specific complications (boundary singularities, truncation) vanish.\n\n(L2) TV REGULARIZATION IS REMOVED: The Turaev-Viro state sum TV_r(M) provides a finite regularization of the (divergent) Ponzano-Regge partition function PR(M). As r -\u003e infinity, the regularization is removed: the truncation of the spin sum is lifted and the quantum dimensions [2l+1]_q -\u003e 2l+1. The PR sum sum_{colorings} prod_{edges} (-1)^{2l}(2l+1) prod_{tetrahedra} {6j} is formally divergent for closed 3-manifolds and requires independent regularization (the TV sum at finite r IS the standard regularization). The cosmological constant Lambda = 4*pi^2/(r-2)^2 = 4*pi^2/k^2 + O(k^{-4}) (where k = r-2 is the Chern-Simons level in standard TV conventions) tends to 0, recovering flat 3D Euclidean gravity.\n\n(L3) BLM MODEL RECOVERY: For the BLM model with fixed admissible j, as q -\u003e 1: the q-3j symbols C^j_q -\u003e C^j (real Clebsch-Gordan coefficients), the supercharge Q_q -\u003e Q (the q=1 supercharge of Part I, nodes 1.1-1.2), and the Hamiltonian H_q -\u003e H = {Q, Q^dagger} of the original BLM SUSY quantum mechanics. The SUSY structure H_q \u003e= 0 is present at ALL values of q (including roots of unity, per node 1.4.3) and does not need to be recovered -- what is recovered in the q -\u003e 1 limit is the specific algebraic simplifications of the q=1 case (reality of all coefficients, absence of truncation constraints). The BLM model parameter j remains fixed throughout this limit; it does NOT scale with r. The limit therefore does not involve any thermodynamic or continuum limit in the BLM model itself.\n\nERRATUM: The original version of this node contained OP2 asking whether the q-BLM model can be given a consistent QM interpretation at root of unity, presupposing that SUSY breaks. This was based on the false premise (inherited from the original 1.4.3) that {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} can have negative eigenvalues at root of unity. As corrected in node 1.4.3, {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} \u003e= 0 is a tautological consequence of the definition of the Hilbert space adjoint and holds for ALL q. The original OP2's three proposed remedies -- (a) modifying the inner product, (b) using Q^2=0 cohomologically without H \u003e= 0, (c) restricting to real q-3j symbols -- were all addressing a non-problem. The revised OP2 above identifies the GENUINE open problems at root of unity, which are representation-theoretic and spectral in nature. The r -\u003e infinity section has also been corrected to remove the false reference to a 'SUSY obstruction (1.4.3)' that disappears as q -\u003e 1.","new_statement":"Step 1.4.4 (Open problems and the r -\u003e infinity limit): This node discusses open problems for the q-BLM model at root of unity q = exp(2*pi*i/r) and the recovery of the q=1 model in the r -\u003e infinity limit.\n\nADMISSIBILITY CONSTRAINT (prerequisite for all that follows): At q = exp(2*pi*i/r), the BLM model with spin parameter j (odd integer, j \u003e= 1) requires r \u003e= 3j+2, equivalently j \u003c= (r-2)/3 (rounded down). This ensures: (a) the quantum dimension [2j+1]_q != 0, so the bubble identity normalization is non-singular; (b) the quantum 3j symbols C^j_q(m1,m2,m3) are well-defined -- in particular, the Racah formula for the (j,j,j) 3j symbol has [3j+1]! in its denominator, and at q = exp(2*pi*i/r), [n]_q = 0 when n is a multiple of r, so we need r \u003e 3j+1, i.e., r \u003e= 3j+2, to avoid division by zero; (c) the supercharge Q_q and Hamiltonian H_q = {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} \u003e= 0 are well-defined operators on the Fock space. Examples: j=1 requires r \u003e= 5, j=3 requires r \u003e= 11, j=5 requires r \u003e= 17. Note: the weaker bound r \u003e= 2j+3 (ensuring only [2j+1]_q != 0) is insufficient -- counterexample: j=3, r=9 satisfies r \u003e= 2j+3 = 9 but r \u003c 3j+2 = 11, and [9]_q = 0 appears in [10]_q! = [3j+1]_q! making Delta(3,3,3) undefined.

This does NOT mean the root-of-unity model is trivially identical to the q \u003e 0 real model. Genuine open problems include: (a) BOUNDARY BEHAVIOR: At the admissibility boundary j = (r-2)/3 (rounded down), the quantum dimension [2j+1]_q = [r-1]_q = sin((r-1)*pi/r)/sin(pi/r) remains nonzero (indeed [r-1]_q = 1 when 2j+1 = r-1), so the bubble identity normalization 1/[2j+1]_q is perfectly finite. However, [2j+2]_q = [r]_q = 0 at the boundary where 2j+2 = r, which causes genuine complications: recoupling identities involving sums over intermediate spins up to j+1 (such as the Biedenharn-Elliott identity and orthogonality relations for 6j symbols) encounter vanishing quantum dimensions in their range, and quantum 6j symbols whose entries involve spins at or beyond the truncation bound may have singular Racah formula evaluations (quantum factorials [n]_q! with n \u003e= r have vanishing factors since [r]_q = 0). What is the behavior of the BLM spectrum and Feynman diagram expansion near this boundary? Is there a well-defined limiting procedure as j approaches the admissibility bound? (b) SPECTRAL GAP DEPENDENCE ON r: For fixed admissible j, how does the spectral gap of H_q = {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} depend on r? Does it remain bounded away from zero, or does it close as r decreases toward the admissibility bound 3j+2?

The TV state sum uses all half-integer spins l = 0, 1/2, 1, ..., (r-2)/2. If a BLM-to-TV connection exists, it must account for this mismatch. One possibility: the BLM model at fixed odd integer j corresponds to a single-coloring sector of a TV-like state sum, where all edge labels in the triangulation equal j. For this single-coloring interpretation to be consistent, the coloring (j,j,j) must be TV-admissible. The TV admissibility conditions from node 1.4 are: (i) triangle inequality |a-b| \u003c= c \u003c= a+b (trivially satisfied for (j,j,j)), (ii) a+b+c is an integer (satisfied since 3j is an integer for integer j), and (iii) the LEVEL TRUNCATION condition a+b+c \u003c= r-2, which for (j,j,j) requires 3j \u003c= r-2, i.e., j \u003c= (r-2)/3. This level truncation condition coincides with the Racah admissibility bound r \u003e= 3j+2. Consequently, the single-coloring interpretation splits the analysis into two regimes: (REGIME I) j \u003c= (r-2)/3: The coloring (j,j,j) is TV-admissible, and the single-coloring sector interpretation is consistent at the level of admissibility. (REGIME II) (r-2)/3 \u003c j \u003c= (r-2)/2: The coloring (j,j,j) FAILS TV admissibility because 3j \u003e r-2, even though the weaker quantum-dimension constraint [2j+1]_q != 0 still holds. Concrete example: r = 9, j = 3 (odd, satisfies j \u003c= 3.5 = (r-2)/2), but 3j = 9 \u003e 7 = r-2, so (3,3,3) is NOT TV-admissible. However, with the correct Racah bound r \u003e= 3j+2, j=3 requires r \u003e= 11, so r=9 is already excluded as inadmissible. For spins in Regime II (which are inadmissible under the Racah bound but satisfy the weaker quantum-dimension constraint), any BLM-to-TV connection would require a different form than the naive single-coloring sector. Even in Regime I, this interpretation requires two caveats: (I) a single-coloring sector of a TV state sum applied to a specific triangulation gives a single amplitude, while the BLM model produces a perturbative series summing over all Feynman diagram topologies -- the comparison must account for the sum over diagram topologies on the BLM side and triangulations on the TV side; (II) a TV state sum restricted to a single coloring is NOT triangulation-independent, so the single-coloring sector interpretation does not yield a topological invariant. The precise nature of the BLM-to-TV relationship remains open.\n\nTHE r -\u003e INFINITY LIMIT: As r -\u003e infinity, q = exp(2*pi*i/r) -\u003e 1. Three things happen:\n\n(L1) REPRESENTATION TRUNCATION DISAPPEARS: The spin truncation bound (r-2)/3 -\u003e infinity, so the admissibility constraint j \u003c= (r-2)/3 becomes vacuous for any fixed j. In this limit, q -\u003e 1 and all q-deformed quantities converge to their classical q=1 values: quantum dimensions [2l+1]_q -\u003e 2l+1, quantum 3j and 6j symbols approach their classical (real-valued) counterparts, and the truncated representation category of U_q(su(2)) at root of unity is replaced by the unrestricted classical representation theory of su(2) (i.e., the q=1 case). In particular, the root-of-unity-specific complications (boundary effects from [r]_q = 0, level truncation) vanish.\n\n(L2) TV REGULARIZATION IS REMOVED: The Turaev-Viro state sum TV_r(M) provides a finite regularization of the (divergent) Ponzano-Regge partition function PR(M). As r -\u003e infinity, the regularization is removed: the truncation of the spin sum is lifted and the quantum dimensions [2l+1]_q -\u003e 2l+1. The PR sum sum_{colorings} prod_{edges} (-1)^{2l}(2l+1) prod_{tetrahedra} {6j} is formally divergent for closed 3-manifolds and requires independent regularization (the TV sum at finite r IS the standard regularization). The cosmological constant Lambda = 4*pi^2/(r-2)^2 = 4*pi^2/k^2 + O(k^{-4}) (where k = r-2 is the Chern-Simons level in standard TV conventions) tends to 0, recovering flat 3D Euclidean gravity.\n\n(L3) BLM MODEL RECOVERY: For the BLM model with fixed admissible j, as q -\u003e 1: the q-3j symbols C^j_q -\u003e C^j (real Clebsch-Gordan coefficients), the supercharge Q_q -\u003e Q (the q=1 supercharge of Part I, nodes 1.1-1.2), and the Hamiltonian H_q -\u003e H = {Q, Q^dagger} of the original BLM SUSY quantum mechanics.

Additionally, OP2(a) originally claimed that '1/[2j+1]_q diverges at j = (r-2)/2'; this was false since [2j+1]_q = [r-1]_q = 1 at this boundary. The corrected OP2(a) identifies the genuine boundary mechanism: [2j+2]_q = [r]_q = 0, which affects recoupling identities and 6j symbol evaluations near the truncation bound. The admissibility bound has also been corrected from r \u003e= 2j+3 to r \u003e= 3j+2, as the Racah formula for the (j,j,j) 3j symbol has [3j+1]! in its denominator requiring r \u003e 3j+1.","owner":"prover-144-v5"}
