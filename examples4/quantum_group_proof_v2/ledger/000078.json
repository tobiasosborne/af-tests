This would immediately determine whether D^BPS_q = D^BPS at these values. The BLM paper already has code for j up to 11 (Draft.tex line 1349, spectral form factor computation). Running the same code with quantum 3j symbols would be the most direct path to resolving the open question. The node should mention this as the most accessible approach.\n\n(2) SPECTRAL GAP ARGUMENT COULD BE MADE MORE PRECISE: The node mentions a 'spectral gap argument' as one resolution path. More precisely: if lambda_1(q) = min nonzero eigenvalue of H_q is continuous in q and lambda_1(1) \u003e 0 (which is true since the BLM model has a gap above the BPS sector), then lambda_1(q) \u003e 0 in a neighborhood of q=1, which implies dim(ker H_q) = dim(ker H_1) = D^BPS for q near 1 by upper semicontinuity of kernel dimension. This is a standard argument from perturbation theory of self-adjoint operators (Kato's theorem). The open question would then reduce to whether the gap persists for ALL q \u003e 0, not just near q=1.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
