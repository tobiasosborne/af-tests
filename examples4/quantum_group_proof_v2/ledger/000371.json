All 9 verification points PASS:\n\n(1) ADMISSIBILITY BOUND: r \u003e= 3j+2 correctly stated. Equivalence j \u003c= (r-2)/3 verified: at r=3j+2, (r-2)/3 = 3j/3 = j. Examples (j=1-\u003er\u003e=5, j=3-\u003er\u003e=11, j=5-\u003er\u003e=17) match child 1.4.3.\n\n(2) REALITY OF q-3j SYMBOLS: Correct. [n]_q = sin(n*pi/r)/sin(pi/r) \u003e 0 for 1\u003c=n\u003cr. Under r\u003e=3j+2, all n in Racah formula satisfy n\u003c=3j+1\u003cr, so all [n]_q positive real, all quantum factorials positive real, Delta(j,j,j) positive real.\n\n(3) FAILURE MODE: Precise. [3j+1]_q! contains [r]_q=0 when r\u003c=3j+1. Confirmed by child 1.4.4 counterexample j=3, r=9.\n\n(4) REGIME I ESTABLISHED: Consistent with validated child 1.2.\n\n(5) REGIME II CONJECTURAL: Correctly labeled, cites Taylor-Woodward 2005 open conjecture. Consistent with validated child 1.3.\n\n(6) REGIME III MIXED STATUS: No overclaiming. BLM-to-TV stated as open problem. References 1.4.2, 1.4.4.\n\n(7) SYNTHESIS: All four children 1.1-1.4 correctly referenced with epistemic qualifiers.\n\n(8) EPISTEMIC LABELS: Decreasing status correctly applied across regimes.\n\n(9) SUSY: {Q,Q^dag}\u003e=0 tautological for any Q on Hilbert space -- correct.\n\nVERDICT: Node 1 statement is MATHEMATICALLY SOUND. Formal acceptance blocked only by framework constraint (child 1.4 pending due to child 1.4.4 having unresolved note/minor challenges, none blocking). No mathematical errors found in the root synthesis.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
