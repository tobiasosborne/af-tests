This is an oversimplification. Total antisymmetry of C plus Grassmann anticommutation is NECESSARY but NOT SUFFICIENT for Q^2 = 0 in general. A generic totally antisymmetric tensor C(m1,m2,m3) on N=2j+1 modes does not yield Q^2 = 0 for N \u003e= 7 (j \u003e= 3): the product Q^2 involves contracting two copies of C over shared fermion indices, and the vanishing of these contractions is a non-trivial algebraic identity specific to the Clebsch-Gordan structure of the (j,j,j) 3j symbol -- not a consequence of antisymmetry alone. Concretely, for j=3 (N=7), Q^2 has 7 independent 6-fermion terms (one for each missing index from {-3,...,3}), and the vanishing of each coefficient requires a specific identity on sums of products of 3j symbols. This identity follows from U_q(su(2)) recoupling theory (selection rules in the tensor product decomposition V_j tensor V_j), not from antisymmetry per se. The statement should say something like 'uses the total antisymmetry of C^j_q, the Grassmann anticommutation of fermions, and the Clebsch-Gordan orthogonality/recoupling identity for the (j,j,j) coupling.' The CONCLUSION Q_q^2 = 0 is correct for admissible j -- only the justification is imprecise.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
