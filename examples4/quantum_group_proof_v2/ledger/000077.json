However, examining the actual BLM proof of E(1/6)=0 (Draft.tex lines 1654-1703), the bubble identity enters at only ONE step: evaluating the partial sum with m1=0 (line 1670-1676). The MAIN obstacle for q-deformation is the 6-fold sign-sector decomposition (lines 1690-1698), which uses: (a) column permutation symmetry of 3j symbols, and (b) simultaneous sign flip (m_i -\u003e -m_i) symmetry to argue that all 6 sign sectors (++-, +-+, -++, --+, -+-, +--) contribute equally to the sum. For quantum 3j symbols, the Regge symmetries acquire q-dependent phase factors (the column permutation picks up factors of q^{f(m)} from the quantum CG coefficients), which BREAKS the equal-weight decomposition of the 6 sign sectors. This is the primary obstruction, not the bubble identity change. The node should more precisely identify that the q-Regge symmetry phase factors are the key obstacle, with the bubble identity change being secondary.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
