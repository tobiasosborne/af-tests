For q = exp(2*pi*i/r) with r a positive odd integer, and 6-tuples (j1,...,j6) satisfying Turaev-Viro admissibility (each ji \u003c (r-2)/2), scaling all spins proportionally with r, the quantum 6j symbol has exponential asymptotics:\n  lim_{r -\u003e inf, r odd} (2*pi/r) * ln|{j1 j2 j3; j4 j5 j6}_{q=exp(2*pi*i/r)}| = Vol(Delta_hyp)\nwhere Vol(Delta_hyp) is the volume of the generalized hyperbolic tetrahedron whose dihedral angles are determined by the ratios of spins to r via the Gram matrix construction. This volume can be positive (exponential growth), negative (exponential decay), or zero, depending on the specific geometric configuration of the tetrahedron, NOT simply on the value of q. References: Belletti-Yang (J Topology 2025, arXiv:2308.13864), extending earlier work of Costantino (Geom Topol 2007) and Belletti-Detcherry-Kalfagianni-Yang (J Diff Geom 2022).\n\n(B) FIXED REAL q \u003e 0 REGIME (CONJECTURAL). For fixed real q \u003e 0, q != 1, with all spins scaling as j_i -\u003e n*j_i and n -\u003e infinity, Taylor-Woodward (Selecta Math 2005, Section 9) STATE WITHOUT PROOF that the asymptotics should be governed by hyperbolic tetrahedron volumes. This remains an OPEN CONJECTURE. No rigorous proof exists in the literature for this regime.\n\n(C) q \u003c-\u003e q^{-1} SYMMETRY CONSTRAINT. For the standard quantum 6j symbol defined via finite-dimensional representations of U_q(sl_2), the quantum integer [n]_q = (q^n - q^{-n})/(q - q^{-1}) satisfies [n]_q = [n]_{q^{-1}}. Since the 6j symbol is a rational function of q-factorials, it follows that {6j}_q = {6j}_{q^{-1}}. Therefore, ANY asymptotic formula must satisfy the same symmetry: the exponential growth rate (if it exists) must be invariant under q -\u003e q^{-1}. In particular, the rate CANNOT be positive for q \u003e 1 and negative for q \u003c 1 (or vice versa). If exponential growth occurs for q \u003e 1, the same growth rate must hold for q^{-1} \u003c 1.\n\n(D) REGIME DISTINCTION. The root-of-unity regime (A) and the fixed-real-q regime (B) are qualitatively different and must not be conflated:\n  - In regime (A): q = exp(2*pi*i/r) is complex, |q| = 1, both q and spins scale together with r, and the geometric data (dihedral angles) come from spin/r ratios.\n  - In regime (B): q is real and fixed, only spins grow, and no analogous Gram matrix construction is established. The relevant algebraic object would be U_q(sl(2,R)) with its modular double structure (Faddeev 1999, Ponsot-Teschner 2001), whose b-6j symbols have semiclassical asymptotics governed by hyperbolic tetrahedron volumes (Teschner-Vartanov 2014), but this involves continuous (not finite-dimensional) representations.\n\nSTATUS: The parent node 1.3 should be understood as follows: the proven root-of-unity results (A) motivate the CONJECTURE that exponential 6j asymptotics persist for real q, and this conjecture, if true, would imply breakdown of melonic dominance. The fixed-real-q asymptotics required for the q-BLM model remain unproven.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"aa9a56ef8000f41075a3aa6afd0a606943e70d6f4d4d0166208d6f47e4faea63","created":"2026-02-11T20:02:10.114800196Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
