This cancellation is UNPROVEN for q != 1.\"\n\n(2) \"SMOOTH\" IS AMBIGUOUS AND POTENTIALLY FALSE: SUSY being preserved (Q_q^2 = 0, H_q \u003e= 0) is NOT the same as the BPS sector being \"smooth.\" The BPS sector ker(H_q) = ker(Q_q) intersect ker(Q_q-dagger) could have JUMPING DIMENSION — the dimension of the kernel of a q-dependent matrix can jump discontinuously. \"Smooth\" would require either:\n(a) dim(ker H_q) is constant in q (unproven, contradicted by 1.3.5 being open), or\n(b) The BPS states deform smoothly as functions of q (requires a spectral gap above the BPS sector, which is also unproven).\n\n(3) THE CONFLATION: The node parenthetically equates \"smooth\" with \"SUSY preserved for all q\u003e0,\" but these are logically distinct statements:\n- \"SUSY preserved\" = the algebraic structure Q^2 = 0, H = {Q,Q-dagger} holds. This IS true for all q \u003e 0 (node 1.1 validated).\n- \"BPS sector smooth\" = the zero-energy eigenspace varies smoothly/has constant dimension. This is UNPROVEN.\n\nThe node cannot claim the BPS sector is smooth while the proof tree's own node 1.3.5 identifies this as an open question. At minimum, the claim should be weakened to: \"The SUSY algebra is preserved for all q \u003e 0, but whether the BPS degeneracy is constant across q = 1 is an open question (see 1.3.5).\"","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
