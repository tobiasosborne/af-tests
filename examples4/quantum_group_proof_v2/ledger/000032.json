In this limit, q -\u003e 1 along roots of unity. The conjecture says lim_{N-\u003einf} (2*pi/N) * log|J_N(K; e^{2*pi*i/N})| = Vol(S^3 \\ K). This is qualitatively different from the regime claimed in node 1.3 (fixed q \u003e 0 real, q \\!= 1, with spins j -\u003e infinity). In the Volume Conjecture, q varies (approaching 1) and is correlated with the representation label N. In the node's claimed regime, q is fixed and only j varies. Calling the fixed-q-real regime the 'Volume Conjecture regime' is misleading. The connection exists only through an intermediate analogy: both involve hyperbolic volumes. But the mathematical mechanisms are entirely different - one involves a semiclassical limit along roots of unity, the other (if proven) would be a fixed-deformation-parameter large-spin limit.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
