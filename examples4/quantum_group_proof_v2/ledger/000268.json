The amended node still has '(no dependencies declared).' While the previous challenge was marked resolved (presumably by the amendment), the amendment did not actually add the dependencies. The node also implicitly depends on the definition of Q_q and the Fock space structure from earlier nodes (1.1 or similar). These should be listed as formal dependencies for the proof tree's logical integrity.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
