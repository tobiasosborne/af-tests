This is wrong. At j = (r-2)/2, we have 2j+1 = r-1, and the quantum integer [r-1]_q = sin((r-1)*pi/r)/sin(pi/r) = sin(pi - pi/r)/sin(pi/r) = sin(pi/r)/sin(pi/r) = 1. This equals 1 for ALL r \u003e= 3, regardless of the parity of r. Therefore the bubble normalization 1/[2j+1]_q = 1/[r-1]_q = 1 is perfectly well-defined at the boundary, and there is NO dependence on the parity of r. The genuine issue at the boundary j = (r-2)/2 is that [2j+2]_q = [r]_q = 0, which affects OTHER recoupling identities (such as the Biedenharn-Elliott identity or orthogonality relations for 6j symbols that involve sums over spins up to j+1), but the specific normalization factor 1/[2j+1]_q is NOT singular at the boundary.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
