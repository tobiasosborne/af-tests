The proposal that 'the BLM model at odd integer j corresponds to a TV-like state sum restricted to colorings where all edge labels equal j (a single-coloring sector)' is a reasonable conjecture.\n\nHowever, there is a subtlety: in the TV state sum, a 'single-coloring sector' where all edge labels equal j would require the 6j symbols {j j j; j j j} (all spins equal to j) to be well-defined and nonzero. The quantum 6j symbol with all spins equal is nonzero only when certain admissibility conditions are met (triangle inequality is trivially satisfied for (j,j,j), but the parity condition requires 3j to be an integer, which holds for integer j). So the single-coloring interpretation is consistent at the level of admissibility.\n\nBUT: the BLM Feynman expansion contains diagrams of varying topology (melonic, non-melonic, etc.), not just tetrahedra. A 'single-coloring sector of TV' applied to a specific triangulation gives a single number, while the BLM model produces a perturbative series summing over all diagram topologies. The comparison between these two objects is not as straightforward as the node suggests. The node should note that the 'single-coloring sector' interpretation would need to account for the sum over Feynman diagram topologies on the BLM side.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
