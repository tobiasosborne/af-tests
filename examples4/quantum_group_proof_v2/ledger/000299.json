However, the formal dependency list in the proof tree metadata shows '(no dependencies declared).' Two previous challenges about this (ch-7e1f32e2b7433fdc and ch-297705f01c3344c0) were marked resolved, but the formal dependencies were never actually added. While the informal statement of dependencies in the text is adequate for human readers, the proof tree's formal dependency mechanism exists for a reason (logical integrity, taint propagation, automated checking). Nodes 1.1 (Q_q definition, Fock space), 1.4.1 (TV state sum), and 1.4.2 (BLM-GFT analogy) should be formally declared as dependencies.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
