But this geometric object is not defined for the claimed regime.\n\nIn the root-of-unity literature (Belletti-Yang), the construction is: given an admissible 6-tuple of spins at q = e^{2*pi*i/r}, the dihedral angles of a tetrahedron are determined by the ratios of spins to r. The Gram matrix then determines whether the tetrahedron is spherical, Euclidean, or hyperbolic, and its volume is computed accordingly.\n\nFor FIXED real q \u003e 0 with spins scaling as n -\u003e infinity, this construction does not directly apply because:\n(a) The dihedral angles in the root-of-unity construction depend on the ratio spin/r, which has no analogue when q is fixed real.\n(b) The Gram matrix construction uses cos(theta) values derived from the root-of-unity parameters; for real q, the corresponding object would involve cosh(t) values from the hyperbolic metric exp(t) = q, but this identification is not established rigorously.\n(c) The volume of a generalized hyperbolic tetrahedron can be positive, negative, or zero (as Belletti-Yang note), but the sign depends on the specific geometric configuration, not simply on whether q \u003e 1 or q \u003c 1.\n\nThe node needs to DEFINE Vol_hyp(Delta(q,j_i)) for real q and PROVE (or cite a proof of) the claimed asymptotic formula.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
