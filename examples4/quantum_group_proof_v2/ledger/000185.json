However, it NEVER states the essential constraint: the BLM spin parameter j must satisfy j \u003c= (r-2)/2, equivalently r \u003e= 2j+3 (for integer j, since r must be at least 2j+3 to ensure j is a strictly admissible spin).\n\nWithout this constraint:\n- The quantum dimension [2j+1]_q = sin((2j+1)*pi/r)/sin(pi/r) vanishes when 2j+1 = r, making the BLM normalization factor sqrt(2JN) = sqrt(2j * [2j+1]_q * N) singular.\n- The q-3j symbols C^j_q(m1,m2,m3) may be undefined or have poles.\n- The supercharge Q_q is ill-defined.\n\nThis constraint is relevant to ALL three open problems:\n- OP1: The admissible range for j restricts which BLM sectors can contribute to a TV-type sum.\n- OP2: The Hamiltonian is only well-defined when j is admissible.\n- OP3: The spin content comparison between BLM (odd j) and TV (l \u003c= (r-2)/2) needs the admissibility constraint to even be stated correctly.\n\nThe r -\u003e infinity limit paragraph should also note that the admissibility constraint r \u003e= 2j+3 becomes trivially satisfied as r -\u003e infinity for any fixed j. This was also raised as challenge ch-4246ac870af on the parent node 1.4 but has not been addressed in this child.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
