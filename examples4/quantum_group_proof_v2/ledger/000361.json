The node states: 'Example: r=11, j=3 gives [2j+1]_q = [7]_q = sin(7*pi/11)/sin(pi/11) ≈ 1.563.' Computation: sin(7*pi/11) = sin(114.5 deg) = 0.9096, sin(pi/11) = sin(16.4 deg) = 0.2817, ratio = 0.9096/0.2817 = 3.229. The stated value 1.563 is off by more than a factor of 2. No quantum integer [n]_q at r=11 for any n in 1..10 yields a value near 1.563. The qualitative conclusion (strictly positive at the Racah boundary) is correct, but the numerical example is wrong.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
