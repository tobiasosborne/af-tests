The argument correctly identifies that Q^2 = 0 follows from the total antisymmetry of the q-3j symbols (which is an algebraic identity valid for all q, being a consequence of the Racah-Wigner algebra of U_q(su(2))) combined with the anticommutation relations of the fermion operators. No reality condition on the coefficients is needed. This is the one part of node 1.4.3 that withstands scrutiny.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
