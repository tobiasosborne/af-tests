Without established exponential 6j asymptotics (1.3.1) and a correct diagram scaling analysis (1.3.2), the statements about \"controlling relative weight\" and \"breakdown of perturbative expansion\" have no mathematical content. The node must either: (i) declare these dependencies explicitly (which would propagate taint from the multiply-challenged siblings), or (ii) provide independent justification for its dynamical claims.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
