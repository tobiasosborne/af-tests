This is mathematically false. The Racah formula for the (j,j,j) 3j symbol has [3j+1]\\! in its denominator. At q = exp(2*pi*i/r), [n]_q = 0 when n is a multiple of r. For no zero factors we need r \u003e 3j+1, i.e., r \u003e= 3j+2. The bound r \u003e= 2j+3 is INSUFFICIENT. Counterexample: j=3, r=9 satisfies r \u003e= 2j+3 = 9, but r \u003c 3j+2 = 11. Then [9]_q = 0 appears in [10]_q\\! making Delta(3,3,3) undefined. The validated node 1.4.3 establishes r \u003e= 3j+2. The child 1.4.4.1 has the fix. Node 1.4.4 must be amended. This error propagates to OP2(b) which references 'the admissibility bound 2j+3' instead of 3j+2.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
