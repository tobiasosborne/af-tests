However, the af deps command shows 'No dependencies' -- the formal dependency metadata has not been populated. This same issue afflicts the parent node 1.4.4 and the validated sibling 1.4.3 (which has an open challenge ch-7aaa6aebbd38572d about the same problem). Formal dependencies are needed for taint propagation and automated consistency checking in the proof tree.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
