At q=1, the free energy is dominated by the melonic saddle. For q≠1, the exponential growth of non-melonic diagrams signals a new saddle point structure. The BPS sector (ker H_q) is smooth across this transition (SUSY preserved for all q\u003e0), but the non-BPS spectrum changes qualitatively.","new_statement":"Step 1.3.3 (Qualitative change at q=1 — conjectural, conditional on 1.3.1 and 1.3.2):\n\nDEPENDENCY DECLARATION: This node is entirely conditional on the conjectural exponential asymptotics of quantum 6j symbols for fixed real q (node 1.3.1, part B) and the conditional scaling analysis of node 1.3.2. If those conjectures are false, this node has no content. The proven root-of-unity results (node 1.3.1, part A) motivate but do not establish the claims below.\n\nESTABLISHED FACTS (unconditional):\n(i) At q=1, melonic dominance holds: the leading non-melonic correction (12j cube diagram) is suppressed by (log j)/j relative to the melonic vacuum (node 1.3.2, classical case; Draft.tex lines 612-622).\n(ii) At any fixed j, the Hamiltonian H_q has matrix elements that are rational functions of q, so the partition function Z(q,j,beta) = Tr(exp(-beta*H_q)) is analytic in q for all q \u003e 0. Non-analyticity can only arise in the j -\u003e infinity limit.\n(iii) The SUSY algebraic structure (Q_q^2 = 0, H_q = {Q_q, Q_q^dagger}, H_q \u003e= 0) is preserved for all q \u003e 0 (node 1.1). This is a statement about the algebraic relations, NOT about the BPS degeneracy (see below).\n(iv) The Witten index W(r) = omega^{-N/2}(1-omega^r)^N with N=2j+1 is q-independent (it depends only on fermion counting, not couplings).\n\nCONDITIONAL ANALYSIS (assuming conjectural exponential 6j asymptotics for fixed real q):\n\nIF the quantum 6j (and higher recoupling) symbols grow exponentially for fixed real q \\!= 1 (node 1.3.1 conjecture), THEN the polynomial suppression mechanism that enforces melonic dominance at q=1 fails (node 1.3.2 conditional analysis). This would constitute a qualitative change in the large-j behavior at q=1, in the following precise sense:\n\n(a) CHANGE IN THE DIAGRAM EXPANSION: At q=1, the 1/j expansion (organizing vacuum diagrams by topology, with melonic diagrams dominating) converges, and the melonic Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equations close because non-melonic contributions are suppressed. For q \\!= 1, if non-melonic diagrams grow exponentially while melonic ones grow polynomially (or decay exponentially, depending on vertex normalization — see node 1.3.2 cases (a) and (b)), the 1/j expansion DIVERGES. This is a loss of the SD-equation solvability mechanism, not the discovery of a new saddle point. The melonic SD equations close precisely because non-melonic diagrams are suppressed; if that suppression fails, the SD equations receive contributions from infinitely many diagram topologies and do not close.\n\n(b) WHY THIS IS NOT A 'PHASE TRANSITION' IN THE TECHNICAL SENSE: A phase transition requires non-analyticity of a thermodynamic potential. For the q-BLM model, one could define a free energy density f(q,beta) = lim_{j-\u003einf} -(1/j) log Tr(exp(-beta*H_q)), but: (1) the existence of this limit for q \\!= 1 is unproven — if the 1/j expansion diverges, the limit may not exist without resummation; (2) even if it exists, non-analyticity at q=1 requires control of the interchange of limits (q -\u003e 1 and j -\u003e inf), which has not been analyzed; (3) the correct analogy is closer to a MATRIX MODEL CRITICAL POINT where planar dominance breaks down (requiring a double-scaling limit with fine-tuning), not a simple thermodynamic phase transition.\n\n(c) LOSS OF SOLVABILITY VS NEW PHYSICS: In SYK-like models, the melonic saddle provides solvability — a closed set of SD equations with a conformal solution at low energies. If melonic dominance breaks down for q \\!= 1, the correct statement is that the SYK solvability mechanism fails, and understanding the large-j physics would require new techniques (resummation, double-scaling, or a fundamentally different approach). Whether any new solvable structure emerges is an OPEN QUESTION. The analogy with matrix models suggests this is possible (the double-scaling limit of matrix models IS solvable via different techniques), but no concrete mechanism has been identified for the q-BLM model.\n\nBPS SECTOR — OPEN QUESTION (not 'smooth'):\nThe SUSY algebra Q_q^2 = 0 and H_q \u003e= 0 hold for all q \u003e 0 (established, node 1.1). However, whether the BPS degeneracy D^BPS_q = dim(ker H_q) equals D^BPS = 2 * 3^j for all q \u003e 0 is an OPEN QUESTION (node 1.3.5). The Witten index constrains but does not determine D^BPS_q. Upper semicontinuity of kernel dimension and continuity of the spectral gap (if the gap persists) would imply D^BPS_q = D^BPS near q=1 (Kato perturbation theory), but global constancy for all q \u003e 0 is unproven. In particular, the Q_q^dagger annihilation condition requires q-dependent cancellations involving q-Regge symmetry phases that have not been verified (node 1.3.5).\n\nNON-BPS SPECTRUM — SPECIFIC CONJECTURAL CHANGES:\nIF melonic dominance breaks down for q \\!= 1 (conditional on 1.3.1-1.3.2), the following specific changes in the non-BPS spectrum are expected:\n(1) The spectral density of H_q at large j would no longer be computable from the melonic SD equations. At q=1, the low-energy spectral density follows from the conformal solution of the SD equations (analogous to SYK). Without SD-equation solvability, the spectral density is inaccessible by current methods.\n(2) The spectral form factor K(t,q,j) = |Tr(exp(-itH_q))|^2 / (Tr(exp(-beta*H_q)))^2 could exhibit different late-time behavior: at q=1 (melonic regime), the ramp-plateau structure characteristic of random matrix universality is expected; at q \\!= 1 (if the diagram expansion diverges), the level statistics could change (e.g., from GUE to a different universality class), but this is entirely speculative without a solvable framework.\n(3) These are statements about what CANNOT be computed, not about what the spectrum IS. The exact spectrum of H_q is analytic in q at any fixed j; qualitative changes (in scaling, level statistics, density of states) can only manifest in the j -\u003e infinity limit.\n\nSTATUS: The q=1 point is a boundary between the melonic-solvable regime and a conjecturally non-melonic regime. Whether this boundary has the character of a phase transition, a critical point requiring double-scaling, or merely a change in computational accessibility is an open question that depends on resolving the foundational conjectures of nodes 1.3.1 and 1.3.2.","owner":"prover-1.3.3"}
