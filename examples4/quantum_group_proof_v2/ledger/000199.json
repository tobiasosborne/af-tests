The validated children have carefully distinguished epistemic status: Part I (q=1): ESTABLISHED/KNOWN (node 1.2 validated). Part II (fixed q \u003e 0, q \\!= 1): CONJECTURAL (node 1.3 validated with explicit 'CONJECTURAL' label). Part III (root of unity): MIXED STATUS with critical unresolved challenges (nodes 1.4, 1.4.3, 1.4.4 all pending). The root node's statement should carry these epistemic labels. A corrected statement would distinguish: (I) q=1 (ESTABLISHED), (II) fixed q \\!= 1 (CONJECTURAL), (III) root of unity (STRUCTURAL ANALOGY + OPEN PROBLEMS). The uniform 'exhibits' framing at the root level contradicts the carefully qualified claims in the children and gives a misleading impression of the proof's actual state.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
