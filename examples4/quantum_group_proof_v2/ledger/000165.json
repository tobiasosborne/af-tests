There is no standard q-deformed Boulatov GFT obtained by naive replacement of SU(2) by U_q(su(2)). The standard approach to obtaining TV amplitudes from a GFT-like framework involves more careful constructions (e.g., Ooguri 1992 for BF theory, or categorical/tensor-network formulations). The claim should specify which construction is meant and cite the precise reference establishing this GFT-to-TV correspondence. Boulatov (1992) and Freidel (2005) establish the SU(2)/PR correspondence; the quantum group generalization requires additional references (e.g., Turaev-Viro 1992 state sum paper, or the categorical GFT constructions of Baratin-Freidel 2011).","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
