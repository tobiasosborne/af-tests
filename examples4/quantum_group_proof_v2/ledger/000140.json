However:\n\n(1) The original Turaev-Viro (1992) formula uses D^{-2v} where v is the number of vertices in the triangulation, not a global D^{-2}. Some presentations (e.g., Kauffman-Lins) absorb vertex factors differently to obtain a global normalization.\n\n(2) Child node 1.4.1 uses the same D_r^{-2} but writes the coloring function as f: edges -\u003e {0,...,(r-2)/2} using integer notation, while the parent node correctly uses half-integer labels l = 0, 1/2, 1, ..., (r-2)/2.\n\n(3) The TV formula also requires admissibility conditions on edge colorings (quantum analog of triangle inequality and parity conditions), which are not explicitly stated.\n\n(4) Some conventions include additional edge weights Delta_{e} = (-1)^{2l_e} [2l_e+1]_q or face/triangle weights. The specific convention should be identified.\n\nThese are minor issues that do not affect the node's main conclusions but reduce precision.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
