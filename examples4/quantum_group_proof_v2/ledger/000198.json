However, the validated child node 1.3 is explicitly titled 'CONJECTURAL' and begins: 'we CONJECTURE that melonic dominance breaks down... This conjecture is motivated by proven root-of-unity results but is NOT itself established.' Specifically: (1) The exponential growth of quantum 6j symbols for fixed real q \u003e 0 (q \\!= 1) is an OPEN CONJECTURE (Taylor-Woodward 2005, Section 9, stated without proof). Only the root-of-unity asymptotics are proven (Belletti-Yang 2025). (2) Even conditionally, the breakdown of melonic dominance depends on unproven assumptions about 12j symbol asymptotics, vertex normalizations, and absence of compensating cancellations (node 1.3.2). (3) The phrase 'Volume Conjecture regime' in the root node is misleading: the Volume Conjecture concerns colored Jones polynomials at roots of unity (a DIFFERENT mathematical regime), not fixed real q. This analogy was carefully qualified in the validated child 1.3.4 but is presented without qualification at the root level. The root node should explicitly label Part II as CONJECTURAL, not present it as an established property of the model.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
