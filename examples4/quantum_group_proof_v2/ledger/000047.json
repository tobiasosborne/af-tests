However, node 1.3.1 has been challenged at the parent level (challenge ch-1689bb57e79f3f87 on node 1.3): ALL three cited references (Taylor-Woodward 2005, Costantino 2007, Belletti-Yang 2025) work at roots of unity, NOT fixed real q \u003e 0. The exponential asymptotics for fixed real q with spins j -\u003e infinity is an OPEN CONJECTURE, not an established result. Without node 1.3.1, the entire exponential analysis in 1.3.2 collapses — there is no basis for claiming the tetrahedron diagram involves exp(j * Vol_hyp). Node 1.3.2 should declare an explicit dependency on node 1.3.1, and since 1.3.1 is unproven, 1.3.2 inherits that failure. This is not a gap that can be patched — it is a foundational dependency.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
