The text states: 'At the admissibility boundary j = (r-2)/3 (rounded down), the quantum dimension [2j+1]_q = [r-1]_q = sin((r-1)*pi/r)/sin(pi/r) remains nonzero (indeed [r-1]_q = 1 when 2j+1 = r-1).' This equation is FALSE at j = (r-2)/3. At the Racah boundary j = (r-2)/3, we have 2j+1 = (2r-1)/3, so [2j+1]_q = [(2r-1)/3]_q, NOT [r-1]_q. Concrete counterexample: r=11, j=3 (which IS the Racah boundary since (r-2)/3 = 3). Then 2j+1 = 7, so [2j+1]_q = [7]_q = sin(7*pi/11)/sin(pi/11) approximately 1.563. Meanwhile [r-1]_q = [10]_q = sin(10*pi/11)/sin(pi/11) = sin(pi/11)/sin(pi/11) = 1. These are NOT equal. The equation [2j+1]_q = [r-1]_q holds only at j = (r-2)/2 (the representation boundary), which is a DIFFERENT boundary from the Racah boundary j = (r-2)/3. The text conflates two distinct boundaries: the Racah admissibility boundary j = (r-2)/3 and the representation boundary j = (r-2)/2. The parenthetical '(indeed [r-1]_q = 1 when 2j+1 = r-1)' refers to j = (r-2)/2, not to j = (r-2)/3 as the sentence structure implies. The qualitative claim (quantum dimension is nonzero at the Racah boundary) IS correct -- [(2r-1)/3]_q is nonzero for all r \u003e= 5 since 1 \u003c= (2r-1)/3 \u003c r. But the specific equation is false and misleading.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
