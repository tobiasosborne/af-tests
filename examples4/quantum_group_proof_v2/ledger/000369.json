The variable 'j' here refers to TV coloring labels, but 'j' was defined earlier in the same section as 'a FIXED odd integer j \u003e= 1' (the BLM parameter). The TV coloring labels were denoted 'l' in section (A). Using 'j' for both in the same sentence creates notational ambiguity. Should read 'summed over all admissible l \u003c= (r-2)/2' to maintain the l vs j distinction established in (A).","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
