This question presupposes that the SUSY QM interpretation is LOST at root of unity, which is the claim of parent node 1.4 section (C) and sibling 1.4.3. However, this claim is mathematically WRONG, as identified in challenge ch-4dfe459e979 on node 1.4.\n\nTHE FUNDAMENTAL FACT: For ANY operator Q on a Hilbert space (finite or infinite dimensional), {Q, Q^dagger} \u003e= 0. Proof: \u003cv|{Q,Q^dag}|v\u003e = \u003cv|QQ^dag|v\u003e + \u003cv|Q^dag Q|v\u003e = ||Q^dag v||^2 + ||Qv||^2 \u003e= 0. This holds for ALL q, including roots of unity, regardless of whether the matrix elements of Q are real or complex. The positive semi-definiteness of H = {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} is NOT an additional physical property that can break -- it is a TAUTOLOGICAL consequence of the definition of the Hilbert space adjoint.\n\nCONSEQUENCES FOR OP2's THREE 'POSSIBILITIES':\n\n(a) 'Modifying the inner product on Fock space to make {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} positive semi-definite': This is UNNECESSARY. The standard Fock space inner product already makes {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} \u003e= 0 for ANY Q_q, at ANY q. There is no need for a 'non-standard inner product depending on q'. The claim that this is needed conflates Q_q^bar (complex conjugation of coefficients) with Q_q^dagger (the true Fock adjoint). These differ when coefficients are complex, but {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} \u003e= 0 always holds with the TRUE adjoint.\n\n(b) 'Working with Q_q^2 = 0 as a cohomological structure without requiring H \u003e= 0': The premise 'without requiring H \u003e= 0' is vacuous because H \u003e= 0 ALWAYS holds. The cohomological structure (Q^2 = 0) is interesting in its own right, but framing it as an alternative to a 'lost' positivity is misleading.\n\n(c) 'Restricting to the subset of q-3j symbols that remain real at root of unity': This restriction is UNNECESSARY for ensuring H \u003e= 0. The reality of q-3j symbols is not needed for positive semi-definiteness of {Q, Q^dagger}.\n\nAll three 'possibilities' in OP2 are motivated by a non-problem. The actual open problem at root of unity is quite different: it concerns whether the q-3j symbols are well-defined (admissibility constraints, singularities when quantum dimensions vanish), not whether SUSY structure is preserved.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
