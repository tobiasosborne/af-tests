{"type":"node_validated","timestamp":"2026-02-11T20:37:34.86894055Z","node_id":"1.3.3","note":"VERIFIED with two minor/note-level issues raised (ch-358f1c1e585f1b59 for missing formal dependency declarations, ch-1d37acc993fe89b6 for SFF normalization convention).\n\nThe node is well-structured and mathematically sound given its explicitly conditional nature. Key verification findings:\n\n(1) DEPENDENCY DECLARATION: Properly stated in text. The node explicitly conditions all non-trivial claims on nodes 1.3.1 and 1.3.2. The formal dependency metadata is empty (minor issue raised), but the textual conditioning is unambiguous.\n\n(2) ESTABLISHED FACTS: All four unconditional facts verified:\n  - (i) Melonic dominance at q=1 confirmed from Draft.tex eqs. (12jasmtot): 12j cube ~ j*(log j)/j, melonic vacuum ~ j.\n  - (ii) Analyticity of Z(q,j,beta) at fixed j follows from Tr(exp(-beta*A(q))) being an analytic function when A(q) is an analytic matrix-valued function (Kato theory).\n  - (iii) SUSY preservation correctly attributed to validated node 1.1, with explicit caveat distinguishing algebraic structure from BPS degeneracy.\n  - (iv) Witten index q-independence: W_r = omega^{-N/2}(1-omega^r)^N matches paper eq. (WI1). q-independence follows from SUSY index theorem for finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces (R = N_psi/3 is q-independent; supertrace kills non-BPS contributions).\n\n(3) CONDITIONAL ANALYSIS: Properly structured as IF-THEN. The explicit statement \"This is a loss of the SD-equation solvability mechanism, not the discovery of a new saddle point\" correctly addresses the earlier challenge about new saddle points. The explicit rejection of \"phase transition\" terminology with a precise explanation of why (no free energy defined, existence of limit unproven, interchange-of-limits issue) is mathematically careful.\n\n(4) BPS SECTOR: Properly flagged as open, correctly referencing node 1.3.5. Upper semicontinuity argument is correctly stated.\n\n(5) NON-BPS SPECTRUM: Properly labeled as conjectural. The explicit statement \"These are statements about what CANNOT be computed, not about what the spectrum IS\" is an important epistemic qualification.\n\nThe node has addressed all 5 previous critical/major challenges satisfactorily. The remaining issues are minor (formal dependencies) and notational (SFF convention). ACCEPT."}
