Since the BLM bound (Condition B: r \u003e= 3j+2) and the TV level truncation for (j,j,j) (3j \u003c= r-2) are IDENTICAL, the 'splitting into two regimes relative to TV admissibility' is trivial: Regime I is exactly the BLM-admissible range, Regime II is exactly the BLM-inadmissible range. There is no splitting relative to TV admissibility because BLM and TV admissibility for the triple (j,j,j) coincide perfectly. The node DOES correctly note that 'In Regime II the BLM supercharge itself is not well-defined, so the BLM-to-TV question does not arise,' which is the right conclusion. However, the framing could be clearer: it would be more transparent to state upfront that the two conditions are identical, rather than presenting a two-regime analysis and then dismissing one regime. This is a presentational observation, not a mathematical error.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
