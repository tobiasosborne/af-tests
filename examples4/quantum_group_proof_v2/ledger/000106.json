A potential approach: embed the BLM model into a Boulatov-type GFT by promoting the fixed spin j to a dynamical variable summed over all admissible spins l \u003c= (r-2)/2 (possibly restricted to odd integers). This would require (a) defining a multi-spin generalization of BLM with fermion species for each admissible l, (b) showing the resulting Feynman expansion produces the TV state sum, and (c) understanding what the single-spin BLM model computes as a 'sector' of the full GFT. None of these steps has been carried out.\n\n(OP2) Root-of-unity Hamiltonian: Can the q-BLM model be given a consistent quantum mechanical interpretation at root of unity? Possibilities include: (a) modifying the inner product on Fock space to make {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} positive semi-definite (this requires a non-standard inner product depending on q); (b) working with Q_q^2 = 0 as a cohomological structure without requiring H \u003e= 0 (topological field theory approach); (c) restricting to the subset of q-3j symbols that remain real at root of unity (this may be empty or trivial for generic r).\n\n(OP3) Spin content reconciliation: The BLM model uses only odd integer j. The TV state sum uses all half-integer l \u003c= (r-2)/2. If a BLM-to-TV connection exists, it must account for this mismatch. One possibility: the BLM model at odd integer j corresponds to a TV-like state sum restricted to colorings where all edge labels equal j (a single-coloring sector). This would give a TV amplitude for ONE specific coloring of ONE specific triangulation, not the full topological invariant.\n\nTHE r -\u003e infinity LIMIT: As r -\u003e infinity, q = exp(2*pi*i/r) -\u003e 1. The spin truncation (r-2)/2 -\u003e infinity. The TV state sum TV_r(M) approaches the Ponzano-Regge partition function PR(M) = sum_{colorings} prod [2l+1] prod {6j} (formally divergent for closed M, requires regularization). The cosmological constant Lambda = 4*pi^2/(r-2)^2 -\u003e 0, recovering flat 3D gravity. For the BLM model with fixed j: as q -\u003e 1, the q-3j symbols become real, the SUSY obstruction (1.4.3) disappears, and we smoothly recover Part I (q=1 BLM model). The BLM model parameter j remains fixed throughout this limit; it does NOT scale with r. The limit therefore does not involve any thermodynamic or continuum limit in the BLM model itself, only the restoration of the q -\u003e 1 algebraic structure.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"7ba7babe160a22ba5a0efdebcbde1f486666d30b4becfefef62ddae81768e6cc","created":"2026-02-11T20:05:22.397812078Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
