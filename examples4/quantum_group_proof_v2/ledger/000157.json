However, the formal dependency metadata shows \"(no dependencies declared)\". This means the taint propagation system cannot track that changes to nodes 1.3.1, 1.3.2, 1.1, or 1.3.5 should trigger re-verification of 1.3.3. While the textual dependencies are clearly stated, the formal dependency mechanism should be used to ensure structural consistency of the proof tree. This is a metadata/tooling issue, not a mathematical error, hence minor severity.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
