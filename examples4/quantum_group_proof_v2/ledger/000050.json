For 0 \u003c q \u003c 1:\n\n[2j+1]_q = (q^{2j+1} - q^{-(2j+1)})/(q - q^{-1}) ~ q^{-(2j+1)}/(q^{-1} - q) ~ q^{-2j}/(q^{-1} - q)\n\nThis grows as (1/q)^{2j}, which has exponential rate 2|log q| = -2 log q (since log q \u003c 0 for 0 \u003c q \u003c 1).\n\nMoreover, node 1.3.1 claims Vol_hyp \u003c 0 for 0 \u003c q \u003c 1, giving EXPONENTIAL DECAY of the 6j symbol. If {6j}_q ~ exp(j * Vol_hyp) with Vol_hyp \u003c 0, and [2j+1]_q ~ exp(2j |log q|), then the exponential growth of the normalization can DOMINATE the exponential decay of the 6j symbol. The ratio exp(j * (Vol_hyp - 2|log q|)) would be doubly suppressed, potentially making non-melonic diagrams even MORE suppressed than in the classical case, not less. This completely reverses the node's conclusion for 0 \u003c q \u003c 1.\n\nThe node claims melonic dominance breaks down for ALL q != 1, but the 0 \u003c q \u003c 1 case may actually exhibit ENHANCED melonic dominance. This asymmetry between q \u003e 1 and 0 \u003c q \u003c 1 is mathematically significant and is not addressed.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
