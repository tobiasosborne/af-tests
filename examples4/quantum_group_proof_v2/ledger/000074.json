The weight of a Feynman diagram in the BLM model depends on: (a) the coupling constants (products of 3j and 6j symbols), (b) vertex normalization factors (unresolved ambiguity per node 1.1.2), (c) propagators (involving the melonic self-energy), (d) combinatorial symmetry factors. The node identifies NONE of these factors explicitly and does not write a formula showing how Vol_hyp enters the ratio of non-melonic to melonic diagrams.\n\n(2) WHAT IS the \"1/j perturbative expansion\"? At q=1, the standard BLM result is that non-melonic corrections are suppressed by powers of 1/j (specifically 1/sqrt(j) for the tetrahedron proxy, (log j)/j for the actual leading correction from the 12j symbol). For q != 1, is the claim that there exists a formal expansion in powers of 1/j that breaks down? If so, what is the expansion parameter, what are the first few terms, and how does Vol_hyp enter the radius of convergence?\n\n(3) The node says \"the breakdown of the 1/j perturbative expansion\" but provides zero analysis of: (a) whether such an expansion exists for q != 1, (b) what the expansion looks like, (c) at what order it breaks down, (d) whether the breakdown is related to Vol_hyp or to some other feature of q-deformation.\n\nThese claims amount to: \"exponential growth of 6j symbols at q != 1 has dynamical consequences for the BLM model.\" This is plausible as a MOTIVATING OBSERVATION but is stated as if it were a theorem. No calculation or even a precise conjecture is provided.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
