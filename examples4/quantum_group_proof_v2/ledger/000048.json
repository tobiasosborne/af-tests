However, the tetrahedron diagram is NOT just a 6j symbol — it includes vertex factors and normalization. From the BLM paper (Draft.tex line 572), the classical tetrahedron diagram is N^2 * {6j}, where N^2 = (2j+1)^2 ~ j^2 provides vertex factors. The {6j} ~ j^{-3/2} from Ponzano-Regge, giving total j^2 * j^{-3/2} = j^{1/2}.\n\nFor the q-deformed case, the vertex factors become q-dependent. Node 1.1.2 establishes that the vertex normalization has two valid choices: (a) classical sqrt(2JN) giving Sigma_q = JN/[N]_q, or (b) q-adapted sqrt(2J[N]_q) giving Sigma_q = J. The vertex factors in the tetrahedron diagram are analogously affected:\n\nCase (a): classical normalization. Vertex factor ~ N = (2j+1). The tetrahedron diagram ~ N^2 * {6j}_q. If {6j}_q ~ exp(j * Vol_hyp), the total tetrahedron diagram ~ j^2 * exp(j * Vol_hyp) ~ exp(j * Vol_hyp) (since j^2 is sub-exponential). So the exponential rate is Vol_hyp. The melonic vacuum ~ j * (JN/[N]_q) ~ j * j/q^{2j} ~ j^2 * q^{-2j} = j^2 * exp(-2j log q). For q \u003e 1, this DECAYS exponentially, while for 0 \u003c q \u003c 1 it GROWS. The ratio involves exp(j * (Vol_hyp + 2 log q)) for q \u003e 1 — NOT exp(j * (Vol_hyp - 2 log q)).\n\nCase (b): q-adapted normalization. Vertex factor ~ [N]_q ~ q^{2j}. The tetrahedron diagram ~ [N]_q^2 * {6j}_q ~ q^{4j} * exp(j * Vol_hyp). The melonic vacuum ~ j * J ~ j. The ratio ~ q^{4j} * exp(j * Vol_hyp) / j, which has exponential rate 4 log q + Vol_hyp, again NOT Vol_hyp - 2 log q.\n\nIn NEITHER case does the node's claimed ratio exp(j * (Vol_hyp - 2 log q)) arise. The node's analysis incorrectly equates the melonic self-energy [2j+1]_q with the full melonic vacuum diagram contribution, ignoring how vertex factors enter the vacuum diagram. The correct ratio depends critically on the vertex normalization choice (an unresolved model-definition question from node 1.1.2), and the node does not even acknowledge this ambiguity.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
