Let me verify the counting explicitly from the BLM paper:\n\n(1) Tetrahedron diagram: From Draft.tex eq.(6jasym) line 572, the full expression is N^2 * {6j}. The Ponzano-Regge formula gives {6j} ~ 1/(j^{3/2}) * cos(...). With N = 2j+1 ~ 2j, this gives (2j)^2 / j^{3/2} = 4j^{1/2}. So tetrahedron ~ sqrt(j). CORRECT.\n\n(2) Melonic vacuum diagram: The melonic vacuum is obtained from the melonic self-energy Sigma = J times a trace over states. From Draft.tex line 526: Sigma = J. The vacuum contribution involves Tr(Sigma * G_0) where G_0 has N states, giving ~ NJ ~ jJ. With J constant, melonic vacuum ~ j. CORRECT.\n\n(3) Ratio 1/sqrt(j): CORRECT.\n\nHowever, the node does not mention that the tetrahedron diagram is only a pedagogical proxy (it does not appear in the actual BLM model), so the '1/sqrt(j) suppression' is illustrative only. The actual first non-melonic correction is (log j)/j from the 12j cube diagram (Draft.tex lines 614-622), which is a STRONGER suppression than 1/sqrt(j).","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
