The node acknowledges that 'with the correct Racah bound r \u003e= 3j+2, j=3 requires r \u003e= 11, so r=9 is already excluded as inadmissible' and notes that Regime II spins are 'inadmissible under the Racah bound.' However, it then continues: 'For spins in Regime II (which are inadmissible under the Racah bound but satisfy the weaker quantum-dimension constraint), any BLM-to-TV connection would require a different form than the naive single-coloring sector.' This framing is logically problematic. If j is inadmissible for BLM under the Racah bound, the quantum 3j symbols C^j_q(m1,m2,m3) with all spins j are UNDEFINED (they involve division by zero in the Racah formula). The BLM supercharge Q_q does not exist for these spins. There IS no BLM model at Regime II spins, and therefore asking about a 'BLM-to-TV connection' in Regime II is asking about a connection from a non-existent object. The node should explicitly state: 'Under the operative Racah bound r \u003e= 3j+2, all BLM-admissible spins fall in Regime I. Regime II is empty for the BLM model, making the BLM-to-TV question moot for these spins.' The current text acknowledges the inadmissibility but presents the Regime II discussion as substantive when it is vacuous.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
