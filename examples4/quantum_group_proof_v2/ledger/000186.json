At q = exp(2*pi*i/r), the representation theory of U_q(su(2)) truncates: only spins l = 0, 1/2, ..., (r-2)/2 are admissible. If the BLM model parameter j exceeds the truncation bound (j \u003e (r-2)/2), the quantum 3j symbols may be ill-defined or require regularization (they involve quantum factorials [n]_q\\! that can have zero denominators). The REAL issue at root of unity is not that SUSY breaks (it does not), but that: (1) The q-3j symbols may not exist for all j when q is a root of unity (division by zero in [n]_q when n is a multiple of r); (2) The inner product on the representation space may need modification (the standard Shapovalov form can become degenerate at root of unity); (3) The model may only be well-defined for j satisfying the truncation bound 2j+1 \u003c= r-1. This genuine subtlety is entirely absent from the node's analysis, which focuses on the incorrect PSD argument instead.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
