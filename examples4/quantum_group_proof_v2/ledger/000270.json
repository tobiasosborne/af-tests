(2) Claim (ii) on positive semi-definiteness {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} \u003e= 0: The tautological norm argument is correct and ironclad. (3) The ERRATUM: The identification Q^dagger = -Q^bar for the cubic supercharge is correct. The sign arises because reversing the order of three anticommuting creation operators introduces (-1)^{3(3-1)/2} = (-1)^3 = -1. The original error in conflating Q^bar with Q^dagger has been properly diagnosed and corrected. (4) The general structure of the representation-theoretic constraints at root of unity is sound, modulo the specific issues raised in my other challenges regarding the exact admissibility bound, boundary behavior, and integer vs half-integer j.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
