The node does not specify any concrete property of the non-BPS spectrum that changes. Possible qualitative changes include:\n- Loss of a spectral gap above E = 0\n- Change in the density of states (e.g., from Wigner semicircle to something else)\n- Appearance of a continuous spectrum (impossible in finite dimension, so not this)\n- Change in level statistics (e.g., from GUE to Poisson)\n- Change in the scaling of the spectral form factor\nNone of these are stated, let alone argued for.\n\n(2) THE CLAIM IS TRIVIALLY TRUE AND THEREFORE UNINFORMATIVE: The non-BPS spectrum of H_q obviously depends on q (the matrix elements of H_q are q-dependent), so saying the spectrum \"changes\" as q varies is a tautology. The word \"qualitatively\" is doing all the work, but without specifying what qualitative feature changes, the statement has no content.\n\n(3) THE NODE'S OWN LOGIC DOES NOT SUPPORT A CONCLUSION ABOUT THE SPECTRUM: Even if the claims about exponential non-melonic asymptotics and melonic dominance breakdown were correct (they are challenged), these are statements about the PERTURBATIVE EXPANSION (Feynman diagram asymptotics), not about the EXACT SPECTRUM. The exact spectrum of a finite-dimensional Hamiltonian is analytic in q, and its qualitative features (e.g., spectral gap, density of states scaling) require separate analysis. The breakdown of the 1/j expansion does not by itself imply any specific spectral feature.\n\nThe node should either specify a concrete qualitative change with a supporting argument, or acknowledge this as an open question.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
