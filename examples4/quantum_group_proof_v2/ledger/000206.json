{"type":"node_amended","timestamp":"2026-02-11T21:21:08.183161724Z","node_id":"1.4.3","previous_statement":"Step 1.4.3 (Critical obstruction: SUSY breaks at root of unity): For q \u003e 0 real, the quantum 3j symbols C^j_q(m1,m2,m3) are real-valued (Part 0, node 1.1.4). At q = exp(2*pi*i/r), they are generically complex. This has three consequences for the BLM model structure:\n\n(i) NILPOTENCY SURVIVES: Q_q^2 = 0 holds at root of unity. The proof uses only the total antisymmetry of C^j_q under column permutations of the 3j symbol, which is an algebraic identity valid for all q (including roots of unity), combined with the Grassmann property of fermions. No reality of coefficients is needed.\n\n(ii) POSITIVE SEMI-DEFINITENESS FAILS: For q \u003e 0 real, Q_q^dagger (the Fock-space adjoint) has the same matrix elements as Q_q with complex conjugated coefficients, which equals Q_q since coefficients are real. At root of unity, define Q_q^bar by complex conjugating the 3j coefficients: Q_q^bar = (1/3!)sqrt(2JN) sum C^j_q(m1,m2,m3)^* psi^dagger_{m1} psi^dagger_{m2} psi^dagger_{m3}. The Fock-space adjoint Q_q^dagger involves BOTH conjugating coefficients AND reversing the Grassmann ordering, giving Q_q^dagger = -Q_q^bar (with the sign from fermion reordering). The operator H_naive = Q_q * Q_q^bar + Q_q^bar * Q_q involves Q_q^bar which is NOT the Fock adjoint. The true {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} = -{Q_q, Q_q^bar} and its eigenvalues need not be non-negative. Explicit example: for the simplest case j=1 (N=3), the 3j symbols at q = exp(2*pi*i/5) are complex, and the spectrum of {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} includes negative eigenvalues.\n\n(iii) BPS STRUCTURE LOST: Without H_q \u003e= 0, the notion of BPS states (ker H_q as ground states) loses its physical meaning. The kernel of {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} is still well-defined as a vector space, but states in it are not guaranteed to be lowest-energy. The Witten index computation from node 1.3.5 (which uses only fermion number, not coupling coefficients) gives a formal answer, but it does not have the usual SUSY interpretation at root of unity.\n\nCONCLUSION: The root-of-unity q-BLM model retains Q_q^2 = 0 (a cohomological structure) and the combinatorial Feynman diagram expansion, but is NOT an N=2 SUSY quantum mechanics. It should be viewed as a formal algebraic/diagrammatic framework whose relation to quantum gravity is through the shared recoupling symbols, not through a well-defined quantum mechanical Hamiltonian.","new_statement":"Step 1.4.3 (Root-of-unity regime: SUSY preserved, representation-theoretic constraints): At q = exp(2*pi*i/r), the q-deformed BLM model retains its N=2 SUSY structure but faces genuine representation-theoretic constraints on admissibility. We establish three facts:\n\n(i) NILPOTENCY SURVIVES: Q_q^2 = 0 holds at root of unity. The proof uses only the total antisymmetry of C^j_q under column permutations of the 3j symbol, which is an algebraic identity valid for all q (including roots of unity), combined with the Grassmann anticommutation of fermions. No reality of coefficients is needed.\n\n(ii) POSITIVE SEMI-DEFINITENESS IS PRESERVED: {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} \u003e= 0 holds at root of unity, just as for q \u003e 0 real. This is a TAUTOLOGICAL consequence of the definition of the Hilbert space adjoint: for ANY operator Q on ANY Hilbert space, \u003cv|{Q, Q^dagger}|v\u003e = \u003cv|QQ^dagger|v\u003e + \u003cv|Q^dagger Q|v\u003e = ||Q^dagger v||^2 + ||Qv||^2 \u003e= 0. This holds regardless of whether Q has real or complex matrix elements.\n\nERRATUM on the original formulation: The original statement of this node claimed that {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} could have negative eigenvalues at root of unity. This was mathematically false. The error arose from conflating Q_q^bar (defined by conjugating the q-3j coefficients while keeping the same fermion operator ordering) with Q_q^dagger (the Fock space adjoint). For the cubic supercharge, Q_q^dagger = -Q_q^bar (with the sign from reversing the order of three fermion creation/annihilation operators). Therefore {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} = -{Q_q, Q_q^bar}. The original argument then incorrectly suggested that since Q_q^bar is not the Fock adjoint, the anticommutator {Q_q, Q_q^bar} could have positive eigenvalues making -{Q_q, Q_q^bar} negative. In fact, {Q_q, Q_q^bar} must have all eigenvalues \u003c= 0, precisely because -{Q_q, Q_q^bar} = {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} \u003e= 0 by the tautological norm argument. The claimed j=1, q=exp(2*pi*i/5) counterexample was also incorrect: for N=3 (three fermion modes), Q_q is proportional to a single cubic monomial psi_{-1} psi_0 psi_1, so {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} = |c|^2 * {A, A^dagger} \u003e= 0 trivially.\n\n(iii) GENUINE REPRESENTATION-THEORETIC CONSTRAINTS: At q = exp(2*pi*i/r), the representation theory of U_q(su(2)) truncates to finitely many admissible irreducible representations with spin labels l = 0, 1/2, 1, ..., (r-2)/2. This imposes three constraints on the BLM model:\n\n(iii-a) ADMISSIBILITY BOUND: The BLM model parameter j must satisfy 2j+1 \u003c= r-1, i.e., j \u003c= (r-2)/2. For j exceeding this bound, the quantum 3j symbols C^j_q(m1,m2,m3) involve quantum factorials [n]_q! with n \u003e= r, and since [r]_q = 0 when q = exp(2*pi*i/r), these factorials vanish, causing the 3j symbols to be ill-defined (division by zero in the Racah formula).\n\n(iii-b) BOUNDARY SINGULARITY: At the boundary j = (r-2)/2, the quantum dimension [2j+1]_q = [r-1]_q approaches a limiting value, while [2j+2]_q = [r]_q = 0. This makes the bubble identity (used in the BLM Feynman diagram evaluation, cf. node 1.2) singular: the normalization factor 1/[2j+1]_q in the bubble requires [2j+1]_q != 0, which holds for j \u003c (r-2)/2 but may fail at the boundary depending on the parity of r.\n\n(iii-c) FINITE TRUNCATION: Unlike the q \u003e 0 real case where the BLM parameter j can be any positive half-integer, the root-of-unity model exists only for finitely many values j = 1, 3/2, 2, ..., (r-2)/2 (restricting to half-integers satisfying the admissibility bound with j \u003e= 1 for the BLM cubic interaction to be non-trivial). This finite truncation parallels the truncation in the Turaev-Viro state sum.\n\nCONCLUSION: The root-of-unity q-BLM model retains its full N=2 SUSY structure for admissible j \u003c (r-2)/2: the supercharge satisfies Q_q^2 = 0, the Hamiltonian H_q = {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} \u003e= 0, BPS states (ker H_q) are genuine ground states, and the Witten index retains its standard SUSY interpretation. The genuine mathematical issues at root of unity are representation-theoretic -- truncation of admissible spins, potential boundary singularities, and the constraint to finitely many models -- rather than a failure of the SUSY structure itself. The combinatorial Feynman diagram expansion and its connection to quantum recoupling symbols (nodes 1.4.1, 1.4.2) also survive intact for admissible j.","owner":"prover-143"}
