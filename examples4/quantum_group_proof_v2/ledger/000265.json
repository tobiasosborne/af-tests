However, the BLM model uses a FIXED ODD INTEGER j \u003e= 1, as stated in (a) the parent node 1.4 section (B): 'The BLM model uses a FIXED odd integer j \u003e= 1 as its spin parameter (N = 2j+1 fermion modes)', (b) the BLM paper Definition 1: 'Fix an odd integer j \u003e= 1', and (c) parent section (C1): 'r \u003e= 2j+3 for the integer case'. The admissible values should therefore be restricted to ODD INTEGERS j = 1, 3, 5, ... satisfying the admissibility bound, NOT the half-integers j = 1, 3/2, 2, ... listed in the node. If the q-deformed generalization genuinely extends to half-integer j, this must be explicitly stated and justified as a departure from the BLM paper. Otherwise the list should be corrected to odd integers only.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
