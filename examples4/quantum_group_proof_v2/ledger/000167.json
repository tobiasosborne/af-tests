More precisely, the Boulatov action has a cubic interaction term (3 fields combined with an orientation-dependent contraction), which generates tetrahedral Feynman diagrams at lowest non-trivial order. The vertex itself in the action is not tetrahedral -- rather, the simplest vacuum Feynman diagram with 4 vertices forms a tetrahedron. This distinction between the interaction vertex in the action and the resulting Feynman diagram topology should be made clearer.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
