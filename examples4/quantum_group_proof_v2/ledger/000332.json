However, 'af deps 1.4.4' returns 'No dependencies.' This exact issue was raised twice before (ch-121ade45a3b77229 and ch-9c21bf70f16842d2), both marked 'resolved,' but the formal dependencies were NEVER ACTUALLY ADDED. The prover has now been through TWO amendments without adding the dependencies. Without formal dependency declarations, the proof tree cannot propagate taint or enforce logical ordering. The node materially depends on: (1) 1.4.3 for the SUSY preservation result and the Racah admissibility bound, (2) 1.4.1 for the TV state sum definition used in OP1, OP3, and L2, (3) 1.4.2 for the BLM-GFT structural analogy used in OP1, (4) 1.1-1.2 for the q=1 BLM model used in L3. All of these must be formally registered as dependencies.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
