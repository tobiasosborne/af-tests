Melonic dominance holds: non-melonic corrections are suppressed by 1/sqrt(j) (tetrahedron/6j) and (log j)/j (cube/12j). The melonic SD equations coincide with N=2 SYK. The 6j symbol asymptotics are controlled by the Ponzano-Regge formula {j j j; j j j} ~ (1/(2^{1/4} sqrt(pi) j^{3/2})) cos(6(j+1/2)arccos(1/3) + 3pi/4), connecting to Euclidean 3D simplicial gravity.
