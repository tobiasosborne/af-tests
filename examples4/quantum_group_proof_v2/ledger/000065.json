These SD equations close PRECISELY BECAUSE non-melonic diagrams are suppressed — the self-energy receives contributions only from melonic diagrams, giving a self-consistent integral equation Sigma(tau) = J^2 G(tau)^{p-1}. This equation has a conformal solution at low energies, which is the \"saddle point.\"\n\n(2) WHY A \"NEW SADDLE\" IS NOT IMPLIED: If non-melonic diagrams become comparable to melonic ones (as the node claims for q != 1), the SD equations do NOT close. The self-energy receives contributions from infinitely many diagram topologies, each with its own q-dependent weight. There is no known resummation that produces a closed set of SD equations in this regime. Without closed SD equations, there is no well-defined saddle point. The correct statement is: loss of melonic dominance means loss of the SD-equation solvability mechanism.\n\n(3) THE ANALOGY WITH MATRIX MODELS IS INSTRUCTIVE BUT OPPOSITE TO THE CLAIM: In matrix models, the 't Hooft large-N limit sums planar diagrams. At the critical point (e.g., edge of the Wigner semicircle), the planar approximation breaks down and non-planar diagrams contribute — but this gives a DOUBLE-SCALING LIMIT requiring fine-tuning, not a simple \"new saddle.\" Similarly, if melonic dominance breaks down for q-BLM at q != 1, the resulting physics requires a fundamentally new framework, not just a \"new saddle point.\" The node's language suggests something has been understood or computed, when in fact the situation is open.\n\n(4) THE ALTERNATIVE: The physically meaningful statement would be: \"For q != 1, IF the exponential growth claim is correct, then the 1/j expansion fails and the model is no longer solvable by the SYK mechanism. Understanding the large-j physics requires new techniques beyond the melonic SD equations.\" This is a statement about an OPEN PROBLEM, not about the existence of a new saddle.\n\nThe claim of a \"new saddle point structure\" is speculation presented as a conclusion. It should be flagged as conjectural at best, and potentially misleading.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
