{"type":"node_validated","timestamp":"2026-02-11T18:59:11.564524327Z","node_id":"1.1","note":"ACCEPTED after thorough verification. All five sub-claims checked:\n\n(1) Q_q^2 = 0: CORRECT. Column-permutation symmetry of q-3j (Groza-Kachurik-Klimyk 1990, Eq.3.12) gives total antisymmetry for j1=j2=j3=j with 3j odd. Combined with Grassmann fermions, Q_q^2 = 0. v1 node 1.1.2 validated (ledger 000040).\n\n(2) Q_q^dagger is true adjoint: CORRECT. For q\u003e0 real, [n]_q is real, so q-3j symbols and sqrt(2JN) are real. v1 node 1.1.4 validated (ledger 000043).\n\n(3) H_q \u003e= 0: TRIVIALLY CORRECT. ||A^dagger v||^2 + ||Av||^2 \u003e= 0.\n\n(4) q-bubble identity: CORRECT. Standard quantum CG orthogonality. v1 node 1.2.1 validated (ledger 000045).\n\n(5) q-9j vanishing (j odd): CORRECT. Column-swap gives (-1)^{3j}=-1 per row, total (-1)^3=-1. v1 node 1.2.4 validated (ledger 000047).\n\nAll five v1 nodes verified in ledger (000040,000043,000045,000047,000059).\n\nCAVEATS (non-blocking): (a) Normalization sqrt(2JN) vs sqrt(2J[N]_q) is a model definition choice, addressed by child 1.1.2. (b) No U_q covariance claimed (correctly flagged as open in child 1.1.1). (c) Convention-dependent reality of q-3j holds in all standard conventions for q\u003e0 real."}
