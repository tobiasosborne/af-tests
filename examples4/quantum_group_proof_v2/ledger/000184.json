Since claim (ii) is mathematically false ({Q_q, Q_q^dagger} \u003e= 0 is an identity that holds for ALL operators on a Hilbert space, regardless of q), the premises for claim (iii) are absent. Specifically: (a) H_q = {Q_q, Q_q^dagger} IS always \u003e= 0, so the statement 'Without H_q \u003e= 0' has a false antecedent. (b) States in ker(H_q) = ker(Q_q) intersect ker(Q_q^dagger) ARE ground states with energy 0, exactly as in the q \u003e 0 real case. (c) The Witten index computation from node 1.3.5 DOES have its usual SUSY interpretation at root of unity. (d) The overall CONCLUSION that the root-of-unity model 'is NOT an N=2 SUSY quantum mechanics' and should be viewed as 'a formal algebraic/diagrammatic framework' without 'a well-defined quantum mechanical Hamiltonian' is unsupported. The root-of-unity model retains N=2 SUSY with a genuine non-negative Hamiltonian, provided the Fock space and adjoint are properly defined.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
