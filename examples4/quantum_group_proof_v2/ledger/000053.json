This formula has multiple errors:\n\n(1) SIGN ERROR FOR THE MELONIC CONTRIBUTION: The node says the melonic self-energy 'involves [2j+1]_q ~ q^{2j}/(q-q^{-1})'. But the melonic self-energy Sigma enters the melonic VACUUM diagram through a trace: melonic vacuum ~ Tr(Sigma * G) ~ sum_m Sigma(m). For the q-deformed case with classical normalization (node 1.1.2 case (a)), Sigma_q = JN/[N]_q, so the melonic vacuum ~ N * JN/[N]_q = JN^2/[N]_q. For q \u003e 1: [N]_q ~ q^{2j}, so melonic vacuum ~ j^2/q^{2j} ~ exp(-2j log q). This DECAYS exponentially for q \u003e 1. The 'melonic side' does not grow as q^{2j} — it decays as q^{-2j}. The ratio tetrahedron/melonic ~ exp(j * Vol_hyp) / exp(-2j log q) = exp(j * (Vol_hyp + 2 log q)), with a PLUS sign, not minus.\n\n(2) CONFUSION BETWEEN SELF-ENERGY AND VACUUM DIAGRAM: The node compares {6j}_q (from tetrahedron) with [2j+1]_q (quantum dimension), but these are not the quantities that enter the ratio of vacuum diagrams. The melonic vacuum diagram involves Sigma_q * (propagator trace), not just [2j+1]_q. The tetrahedron vacuum diagram involves vertex factors * {6j}_q, not just {6j}_q.\n\n(3) FOR q-ADAPTED NORMALIZATION (case (b) of 1.1.2): Sigma_q = J, melonic vacuum ~ NJ ~ j, tetrahedron diagram involves [N]_q^2 * {6j}_q ~ q^{4j} * exp(j * Vol_hyp). The ratio is q^{4j} * exp(j * Vol_hyp) / j, giving exponential rate 4 log q + Vol_hyp. Again, NOT Vol_hyp - 2 log q.\n\nThe formula Vol_hyp - 2 log q does not arise under any consistent treatment of vertex normalizations. The node's central quantitative claim is incorrect.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
