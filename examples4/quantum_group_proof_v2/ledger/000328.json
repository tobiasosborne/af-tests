The Ben Geloun-Bonzom 2011 paper (arXiv:1101.4294, 'Radiative corrections in the Boulatov-Ooguri tensor model: The 2-point function') is about the BOSONIC Boulatov-Ooguri tensor model, not about fermionic tensor models. The paper computes 2-point function corrections in a bosonic colored tensor model. Fermionic tensor models in the literature appeared primarily in the post-2016 SYK era (e.g., Klebanov-Tarnopolsky 2017, Ben Geloun-Rivasseau 2017 'A Renormalizable SYK-Type Tensor Field Theory'). While the node's broader point -- that fermionic GFT extensions exist in the literature -- is directionally correct, the specific citation is wrong. The paper cited deals with bosonic fields, not fermionic ones. The parenthetical should either cite an actually fermionic tensor model paper or be removed/rephrased to say 'the GFT literature includes colored tensor models (e.g., Ben Geloun-Bonzom 2011) but a specifically fermionic GFT adapted for BLM embedding has not been constructed.'","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
