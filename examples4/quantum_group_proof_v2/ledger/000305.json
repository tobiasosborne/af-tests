The node states 'the bubble identity normalization 1/[2j+1]_q diverges at j = (r-2)/2.' This is mathematically false. Computation: at j=(r-2)/2, we have 2j+1 = r-1. Then [r-1]_q = sin((r-1)*pi/r)/sin(pi/r) = sin(pi - pi/r)/sin(pi/r) = sin(pi/r)/sin(pi/r) = 1. Therefore 1/[2j+1]_q = 1/1 = 1 at this boundary -- perfectly finite, not divergent. This was already raised as challenge ch-0c81063e8c675378 and marked 'resolved,' but the fix was NEVER APPLIED to the node 1.4.4 statement. The child node 1.4.4.1 contains the corrected OP2(a) identifying the genuine mechanism: [2j+2]_q = [r]_q = 0 affecting recoupling identities and 6j symbol evaluations near the truncation bound. The parent 1.4.4 still contains the false divergence claim and must be corrected.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
