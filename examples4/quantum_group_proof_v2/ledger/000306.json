However, the formal dependency metadata shows 'No dependencies'. Previous challenge ch-121ade45a3b77229 raised this issue and was marked 'resolved,' but the formal dependencies were NEVER ACTUALLY ADDED. The node references results from 1.4.3 (SUSY preservation, admissibility bound), 1.4.1 (TV state sum definition), 1.4.2 (BLM-GFT analogy), and 1.1-1.2 (q=1 BLM model) throughout its statement. Without formal dependency declarations, the proof tree cannot properly propagate taint or enforce logical ordering. All stated dependencies should be formally registered.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
