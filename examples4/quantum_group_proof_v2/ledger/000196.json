This asserts a mathematical connection between the q-BLM model at root of unity and the Turaev-Viro state sum / Chern-Simons theory. However, NO such connection has been established anywhere in the proof tree. The validated child node 1.4.2 explicitly states: 'the BLM model is NOT a GFT' and 'The map from the full BLM diagram expansion to TV-type topological invariants remains an open problem.' The pending child 1.4.4 (OP1) identifies the BLM-to-TV map as an open problem, noting 'None of these steps has been carried out.' The root node's description of regime (III) presents as established fact what is at best a structural analogy and at worst an unsubstantiated claim. The correct characterization is that the BLM model at root of unity uses the SAME algebraic building blocks (quantum 3j/6j symbols with spin truncation) as the Turaev-Viro state sum, but the BLM Feynman expansion does NOT produce TV topological invariants. Stating regime (III) as 'topological 3D gravity' conflates shared building blocks with an established mathematical equivalence that does not exist.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
