At q=1, the free energy is dominated by the melonic saddle. For q≠1, the exponential growth of non-melonic diagrams signals a new saddle point structure. The BPS sector (ker H_q) is smooth across this transition (SUSY preserved for all q\u003e0), but the non-BPS spectrum changes qualitatively.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"dcd23cea82ad163449811813df2bef0b230a9158d416ab17a29fdd79bf714a54","created":"2026-02-11T18:44:35.964862856Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
