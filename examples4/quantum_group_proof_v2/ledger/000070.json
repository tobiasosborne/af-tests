As N -\u003e infinity, q -\u003e 1 along roots of unity on the unit circle. Both the representation label N and the deformation parameter q change together. The limit is a SEMICLASSICAL limit (hbar ~ 2pi/N -\u003e 0) along a specific path in q-space.\n\nBLM MODEL LIMIT (as claimed in parent node 1.3): q is FIXED and REAL POSITIVE (q \u003e 0, q != 1). The spin j -\u003e infinity. The parameter q does not change.\n\nThese are not merely \"different limits\" — they live in different domains:\n(1) VC: q is COMPLEX (|q| = 1), specifically a root of unity.\n(2) BLM: q is REAL POSITIVE.\n(3) VC: q varies with the representation label.\n(4) BLM: q is fixed while the representation label grows.\n\nThe node implicitly equates Vol_hyp(q) (the exponential growth rate of quantum 6j symbols at fixed real q, an unproven conjecture per challenges on 1.3.1) with the hyperbolic volume appearing in the Volume Conjecture (which concerns roots of unity with both q and N varying together). Even if both quantities happened to involve \"hyperbolic volumes,\" they are DIFFERENT mathematical objects computed in DIFFERENT regimes.\n\nThe node's claim that the BLM model provides a system \"where this exponential growth [from the VC] has direct dynamical consequences\" is therefore without mathematical basis. The BLM model at fixed q does not realize the Volume Conjecture limit.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
