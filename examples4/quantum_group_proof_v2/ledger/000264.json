While Ben Geloun and Bonzom have contributed extensively to tensor models and GFT, the claim that they specifically developed 'fermionic GFT frameworks' suitable for the BLM embedding should cite specific work. The relevant literature includes Ben Geloun-Magnen-Rivasseau (2010) on Borel summability in colored GFT and Ben Geloun-Bonzom (2011) on radiative corrections, but the specific fermionic GFT construction relevant to BLM embedding may not exist in the literature in the form suggested. Without a precise reference, the claim 'cf. Geloun-Bonzom for fermionic GFT frameworks' may mislead a reader into thinking this is a well-developed framework ready for the BLM embedding, when the actual state may be more preliminary. A specific citation or acknowledgment that fermionic GFT is underdeveloped would improve precision.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
