The quantum dimension is [2l+1]_q = sin((2l+1)*pi/r)/sin(pi/r), which is positive for all admissible l. Given a triangulation T of a closed oriented 3-manifold M, the Turaev-Viro invariant is TV_r(M) = D_r^{-2} * sum_{f: edges -\u003e {0,...,(r-2)/2}} prod_{e} [2f(e)+1]_q * prod_{t} {6j}_q(t,f), where D_r^2 = sum_{l=0}^{(r-2)/2} [2l+1]_q^2. TV_r(M) is independent of T (Turaev-Viro 1992). The Turaev-Walker theorem gives TV_r(M) = tau_r(M) * tau_r(-M) = |tau_r(M)|^2 where tau_r is the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant of M (the rigorous version of the SU(2) Chern-Simons partition function at level k = r-2). In the semiclassical limit, TV_r describes Euclidean 3D gravity with positive cosmological constant Lambda = 4*pi^2/(r-2)^2 + O((r-2)^{-4}) (Mizoguchi-Tada 1992). NOTE: TV coloring labels l = 0, 1/2, ..., (r-2)/2 are distinct from the BLM model parameter j (fixed odd integer).","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"0e33479960547709d9531be9c47a691b19f57f90d6db2fd4c6b137d915e668c6","created":"2026-02-11T20:04:23.738273898Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
