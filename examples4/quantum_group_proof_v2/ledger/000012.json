The q-BLM model provides a physical quantum mechanical system where this exponential growth has direct dynamical consequences — it controls the relative weight of non-melonic Feynman diagrams and the breakdown of the 1/j perturbative expansion.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"ce93c26866e83cd750db783111b7d93f94c3539ae055196b4c1af22a877fc3c3","created":"2026-02-11T18:44:35.96487697Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
