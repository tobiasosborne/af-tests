The TV state sum is not over ALL maps f: edges -\u003e {0,...,(r-2)/2}, but only over ADMISSIBLE colorings, meaning those satisfying triangle inequality and parity constraints for each 2-face of the triangulation: for any face with edge labels (a,b,c), we need |a-b| \u003c= c \u003c= a+b, a+b+c is an integer, and a+b+c \u003c= r-2. The notation 'sum_{f: edges -\u003e {0,...,(r-2)/2}}' implies an unrestricted sum, omitting these constraints. The sum should be 'sum_{f admissible}' with the admissibility conditions stated.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
