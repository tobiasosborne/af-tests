CLASSICAL SELF-ENERGY (Sigma = J): CORRECT. Verified against BLM paper Draft.tex. The supercharge Q = (1/3!)sqrt(2JN) sum C psi^3 (line 258). The paper confirms on line 526 that the bubble gives J, independent of N. Two effective vertices give NJ, bubble gives 1/N, total NJ/N = J.\n\n2. Q-BUBBLE IDENTITY: CORRECT. Standard result in U_q(su(2)) representation theory: sum C_q C_q = delta/[2j+1]_q.\n\n3. CASE (a) classical normalization: CORRECT. Sigma_q = JN/[N]_q. q-dependent, reduces to J at q=1.\n\n4. CASE (b) q-adapted normalization: CORRECT. Sigma_q = J. SD equations close identically to SYK.\n\n5. v1 FORMULA J/[N]_q: CORRECTLY IDENTIFIED AS WRONG in both cases.\n\n6. CONCEPTUAL: Normalization choice as model definition is appropriate.\n\nNON-BLOCKING ISSUES:\n(ch-41c10d9863c94bde) Minor: mixed notation conventions for factors of 2.\n(ch-e3630b0733e7f740) Note: case (a) SD equations also close, just with q-dependent coupling."}
