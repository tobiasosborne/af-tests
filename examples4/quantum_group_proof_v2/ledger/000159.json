This formula uses beta in the denominator but no beta in the numerator (no thermal regularization of the trace in the numerator). The standard SFF in the chaos/random matrix theory literature is K(t) = |Z(beta+it)|^2/|Z(beta)|^2 where Z(beta) = Tr(exp(-beta*H)), i.e., the numerator is |Tr(exp(-beta*H - itH))|^2 = |Tr(exp(-(beta+it)H))|^2. In the node's formula with no beta in the numerator, the numerator Tr(exp(-itH)) may fail to converge for unbounded spectra (not an issue for finite-dimensional H_q, but worth noting for conceptual clarity). If beta=0 is intended in both numerator and denominator, the ratio K = |Tr(exp(-itH))|^2/dim(H)^2 is the \"infinite temperature\" SFF. If beta\u003e0 is intended only in the denominator, the formula is non-standard. This is a notational clarification request, not a mathematical error.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
