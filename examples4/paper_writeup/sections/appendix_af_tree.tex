\section{AF Proof Tree Reference}
\label{sec:af-tree}

The results in this paper were verified using an adversarial prover-verifier framework. Each claim was subjected to independent verification by AI agents acting as provers (who construct arguments) and verifiers (who attack them). The following table maps each AF node to its location in this paper and its verification status.
